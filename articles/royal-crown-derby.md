The Royal Crown Derby Porcelain Company, one of the oldest still operating English porcelain producers, was founded in Derby in 1750 and is well known for its prestigious tableware. Despite the company's early success as a leading dinnerware manufacturer in the 18th century, it suffered from frequent corporate takeovers.<sup>1</sup> Nevertheless, the Derby traditions of high-quality craftsmanship, where no two pieces were the same, were upheld. Many of the painters that the company employed in the 18th century had specialities in landscapes and seascapes, still lifes, pastorals, birds, and intricate floral patterns.

## Aesthetics

Because the styles of Royal Crown Derby products consistently matched the vogue of the time, they were in high demand. Their wares began to feature extravagant Japanese Imari patterns in the early 19th century that were bolder, with brighter colours, larger shapes, and geometric patterns.<sup>1</sup> When they made ornamental pieces like service plates and vases that were gilded and jewelled in the late Victorian era, their designs grew more opulent. <sup>1</sup> Beyond their typical styles, The Derby innovated and expanded themselves by incorporating raised gilding, piercing, and Perisian and Indian motifs. <sup>2</sup> However, Derby's tradition of producing beautiful paintings of landscapes and flowers persisted. Their Campaa (or Campagna) vases, which were modelled after Greek kraters and included landscape decorations, are an illustration of this. <sup>3</sup>

## Royal Recognition

The Derby was becoming a more well-known tableware brand in the royal community because of its prestige. King George III had given the Derby permission to use the royal crown as their rear mark in 1773, following a grant to a royal warrant in 1890, becoming the "Manufacturers of porcelain to Her Majesty" and "The Royal Crown Derby Porcelain Company". <sup>1</sup>
