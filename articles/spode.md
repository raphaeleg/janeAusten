Spode, which was established in 1770 by Josiah Spode I, produced earthenware and stoneware. There, two significant pottery techniques were developed: blue transfer printing on underglaze earthenwares, which gave rise to the Spode Blue Italian line, and the standardized recipe for bone china.<sup>1</sup>

Large vases with elaborate neoclassical art decorations and gilding made up Spode's first products. When he was given the title "Potter to the Prince of Wales" by the Prince Regent in the early 19th century, Spode II was among the top producers of Japanese Imari patterns.<sup>2</sup>

## Underglaze blue transfer printing

Underglazing is the process of decorating a surface before glazing it to provide protection.<sup>3</sup>
To transfer the designs from an engraved copper plate to the earthenware surface, Spode developed a method using gummed tissues. A deep cobalt color print was then preserved by using Spode's proprietary glaze recipe. <sup>4</sup> By 1784, this innovation had been perfected.<sup>5</sup>
Beginning with Chinese patterns, the popularity of blue-printed goods increased with the introduction of bamboo, willow, and Greek patterns in the 1800s.<sup>6</sup> By the 1810s, engraved sporting scenes with an Italian backdrop became particularly widespread. <sup>6</sup>

## The bone china formula

By the 1740s, a number of English potters were vying for the recipe to create ceramics that resembled those from China using different, more readily available ingredients. <sup>7</sup> By combining hard-paste porcelain (china clay and china stone mixed together), bone ash, and porcelain, Spode I created the hybrid porcelain "Stoke China" in 1796. <sup>5</sup> However, Spode I died in 1797 before he could perfect this recipe, so Spode II had to continue his work. <sup>7</sup>
The creation was renamed "Bone China" after Spode II perfected a recipe combining hard-paste porcelain and calcined bone. The ware surface took on a warm hue from the addition of bone ash. <sup>7</sup>
