## The Question of Beauty

Every society has a central beauty standard and hierarchy, enabling trendsetters to judge others and themselves incessantly. Paul Valéry argues that humans can never resolve the "three-body problem" within every individual: the gap between the empirical body, the mechanical body, and the aesthetic body. The first body is the one we "possess", the self we experience. He states that it is "the most important object in the world" for every one of us. The second body is a public facade, "the body which has form and is apprehended in the arts, the body on which materials, ornaments, armor sit". The third body is the physical machine we know about "only for having dissected and dismembered it … nothing leads us to suspect a liver or brain or kidney".<sup>1</sup>

Contemporary beauty studies also dwell on three different human bodies. The natural body singles out physical features such as age and health. The cultural body is the product of capitalism and patriarchy, linked to the beauty culture, celebrities, the mass media's attention to fashion, commodity fetishism, medical intervention, and lifestyle changes. Finally, the disordered body highlights various types of pathologies, such as anorexia nervosa, obsessions, and addictions. Body dysmorphia signals an internal battle, highlighting how beauty is often a site of interpersonal struggles due to inborn and social inequalities.

</figure>

According to Naomi Wolf's The Beauty Myth, humans "physically" and "psychologically" destroy themselves in their pursuit of beauty.<sup>2</sup> Despite the evolution of beauty discourses, humans are increasingly left with unhealthy bodies, disordered minds, and empty wallets. Wolf also contests the notion of "universal" and "objective" aesthetics ingrained in the battle of the sexes. Women who value beauty "must want to embody it, and men must want to possess women who embody it. This embodiment is an imperative for women", as it is the "best belief system that keeps male dominance intact" because it is often men who define aesthetic terms.<sup>3</sup> As Jane Sprague Zones points out, once the standard is set, beauty not only exists in the eye of the beholder but also becomes a local or global marker. The Kayan tribe of Thailand idealizes women with elongated necks supported by thick brass rings. Chinese ladies idolized small lotus feet until the twentieth century. Maori trendsetters in New Zealand favor face tattoos and blue lips. At all events, aesthetic standards are relatively collective, "uniform and widely understood models of how particular groups of individuals 'should' look" in a particular society and timeframe.<sup>4</sup>

Beauty is powerful because it unlocks a mode of socialization in which individuals internalize "the process of learning social roles, norms, values, behavior, and social skills and attitudes" to compare themselves to others.<sup>5</sup> In general, a conservative regime often promotes uniform looks for men and women separately, standardizing hairstyles, dress codes, and grooming habits. In contrast, a progressive regime welcomes individuality and radical creativity, so there is no need for all men to wear a beard or for all women to wear a headdress. Either way, "beauty ideals control, restrict, and discipline" human bodies, "desires, and social realities".<sup>6</sup>

The obsession with beauty is real because, as noted by Etcoff, "beauty is convertible into other assets that trendsetters covet, for example, wealth, connections, surplus suitors, and so on". Good looks are the "most fungible asset, exchangeable for social position, money, even love".<sup>7</sup> Humans are limited by Mother Nature and genes. Differences in culture, gender, class and caste systems, colorism, and nationalistic sentiment further structure how humans assess and comprehend beauty at the local, national, and global levels. In the words of Kimberlé Crenshaw, beauty is an "intersectional" concept that constructs hierarchies of race, gender, class, and nationality, reinforcing intersecting typologies of oppression.<sup>8</sup>

Interestingly, beauty is seldom associated with peace. The beauty contest between Venus, Hera, and Athena generated heated anger and enmity among them. Paris considered Venus the fairest due to a bribe when she promised him the most beautiful woman on Earth—Helen of Troy. Helen was beautiful because she enjoyed great blessings in the human and nonhuman domains, being the wife of King Menelaus of Sparta and allegedly the daughter of Zeus. Paris got Helen, but the consequences meant mass destruction, as King Menelaus wanted his wife back and thus summoned men to fight the Trojan War.

## Standards of Beauty

Aristotle's classical view defines beauty in terms of "order, symmetry, and definiteness". For Cicero, it was "a certain symmetrical shape of the limbs combined with a certain charm of coloring”.<sup>9</sup> In the West, beauty is positively correlated to height, fair skin, symmetrical figures, and agile and graceful movements while prioritizing youth and good health. Men are evaluated on their appearance, intelligence, physical prowess, bravery, and heroic status, all of which imply good genetics, good training, and financial capability.<sup>10</sup> Male aesthetics invariably single out virility, agency, and domination. Similarly, size and height matter: "When the eighteenth-century cavalier high boots went out of style, thin-legged men wore two pairs of tights with calf pads tucked inside".<sup>11</sup> Furthermore, the Adonis index denotes a golden ratio that exalts both the Greek aesthetic and manly, muscular beauty.

Women, on the other hand, are scrutinized in minute detail. They are assessed based on their facial features: their forehead, eyebrows, eyes, nose, lips, chin, and cheekbones, as well as how they present, including their airs, speech, clothes, accessories, deportment, and social skills. To improve their features, Egyptian ladies used eye paint, eyeliner, and rogue _(made from red ochre)_. The word "cosmetics" derives from the Greek word kosmetika. White skin is a trademark of the upper classes, and Greek ladies were fond of using "rouge for the cheeks, whitener to make the skin paler, and black eyeliner and eye shadow"<sup>12</sup>. In the Roman world, Nero’s wife, Poppaea Sabina, bathed in ass milk to soften her skin, and her daily bath required the maintenance of 500 such beasts.

Queen Elizabeth utilized her beauty to govern England. She whitened her skin with "Venetian ceruse", a lead-heavy cosmetic product, and dyed her lips crimson with cinnabar, a mercury-rich material. Aside from cosmetics, the shape was also important. Between 1400 and 1700, a plump figure was deemed attractive. In Botticelli's The Birth of Venus, the goddess of beauty is "endomorphic in shape, with a round face and pear-shaped body".<sup>13</sup>

As civilization advanced, culture overrode nature and aestheticizes the unnatural. For example, corsets became compulsory for aristocratic women around the sixteenth century. In Austen’s days, court dress was the highest form of Regency attire, and Queen Charlotte kept her hooped petticoats.

When trains became a common feature of gowns, Oliver Goldsmith felt compelled to offer this comment:

> As a lady’s quality or fashion was once determined here by the circumference of her hoop, both are now measured by the length of her tail. Women of moderate fortunes are contented with tails moderately long but ladies of true taste and distinction set no bounds to their ambition in this particular.<sup>14</sup>

In the latter half of the nineteenth century, a slim waistline became "a hallmark of fashion for women of nearly all classes. Corseted waistlines gave the illusion of voluptuousness", whittling "some women down to a 15-inch waist".<sup>15</sup> However, tight lacing and severe compression harmed internal organs and the rib cage, resulting in faintness, poor digestion, atrophic muscles, and a deformed rib cage. Doctors considered tightly-laced corsets a health hazard as early as the 1790s. In 1890, The Lancet published "Death from Tight Lacing" and other letters, warning ladies that "the male once captured, it was no longer necessary to charm his eye with the slender waist".<sup>16</sup>

## Debunking the Regency Beauty Myth

Austen debunked the Regency beauty myth. In the first place, men set unrealistic standards in assessing women. In his Dictionary of Love _(1753)_, John Cleland translated the work of J.F Dreux du Radier's comprehensive list under the entry "Beauty", arguing that a woman should possess the following 30 traits:

1. Youth
2. Stature, neither too high nor too low
3. Neither too fat nor too lean
4. The symmetry and proportion of all parts
5. Long hair, or prettily curled, fine, and silky soft
6. The skin smooth, delicate, and of a fine grain
7. Lively white and red
8. A smooth high forehead
9. The temples not sunk in
10. The eye-brows in arcade, like two lines
11. The eyes blue, their orbits well fashioned, and turned to sweetness
12. The nose rather long than short
13. The cheeks rounding away in softened profils [sic], and dimpled
14. An agreeable smile
15. Two lips, pouting, of the coral hue
16. A small mouth
17. Teeth, pearly white, even and well set
18. The chin rather round, plump, and ending with a dimple
19. The ears small and close to the head
20. A neck of ivory
21. A breast of alabaster
22. Two balls of snow, firm, self-sustained, and deliciously distanced
23. A white hand, plump and long
24. Fingers tapering
25. Nails of mother-o’-pearl and oval-formed
26. A sweet breath
27. An agreeable voice
28. A free unaffected air and carriage
29. The shape noble, easy, and disengaged
30. A modest gait and deportment<sup>17</sup>

In Pride and Prejudice, Darcy's list implies that he cannot agree with these criteria. In polite society, great emphasis is given to cultural, economic, and political standing, as they recognize that physical beauty is not enough.<sup>18</sup>

In the words of Vanita Reddy, the Regency "beauty assemblage" prioritizes several factors—well-formed features, good airs, excellent accomplishments, a family with good fortune and respectable connections, a beautiful lifestyle that comes with carriages, and social visits and travel opportunities for women and riding, hunting, and fishing activities for men. A good wardrobe is always important. "The Duchess of Hamilton’s dress purchased in 1752, cost almost as much as her husband’s brand new and luxuriously fitted sedan chair. In 1767, Lady Mary Coke spent £70 on silk alone, and in 1790, the Duke of Bedford’s brown striped silk suit embroidered in silver, spangles, and brilliant diamonds was reported to have cost in excess of £500".<sup>19</sup>

Austen's apparent inability to buy such costly attires did not escape public notice. Knowing that Lady B. thought she was "handsomer than she expected" gratified her. However, while acknowledging Austen's appearance, Mrs. Mary Russell Mitford excerptribed her as "the prettiest, silliest, most affected, husband-hunting butterfly she ever remembered."<sup>20</sup> Mrs. Mitford criticized Jane Austen's "lack of elegance" and "taste" even when she became a best-selling author. A friend of the Mitfords linked Austen to an objectified existence, and the author's single status implied financial dependence on her family.

> [Jane] has stiffened into the most perpendicular, precise, taciturn piece of “single blessedness” that ever existed, and that, till “Pride and Prejudice” showed what a gem was hidden in that unbending case, she was no more regarded in society than a poker or a fire-screen, or any other thin upright piece of wood or iron that fills its corner in peace and quietness.<sup>21</sup>

Austen, in her way, worked hard to keep up a good appearance because she was conscious that she lived in an "image-conscious and opinion-sensitive society." <sup>22</sup> Large women were frequently viewed as less fit and potentially less desirable as wives. As a result, Martha, her best friend, romanticized thinness. "Martha looks very well, & wants me to find out that she grows fat; but I cannot carry my complaisance farther than to beleive [sic] whatever she asserts on the subject" _(Letters 66)_.

Austen's letters also reveal her competitiveness and sartorial anxiety. She jokingly wrote to Cassandra that "Miss Fletcher and I were very thick, but I am the thinnest of the two" _(Letters 9)_. To the end of her life, she kept her figure. Her pelisse showed that she was quite tall, "at approximately 5 feet 7 inches, with a 30-32 inch bust, making her a modern UK size 6 or US size 2".<sup>23</sup>

## Unfreedom

Austen simultaneously lived in a transitional period that cried out for "liberty, equality, and fraternity". The French Revolution and the Reign of Terror contributed much to this dramatic aesthetic shift, making the display of physical and financial assets downright dangerous. Horace Walpole’s pre-revolutionary criteria of beauty singled out the courtly aesthetics, mentioning "the presence of a roman nose, hair laced with jewels, a crown, and a splendid costume of rich fabric, an enormous ruff, and 'bushels' of pearls".<sup>24</sup> When Austen's cousin and later sister-in-law Elizabeth Hancock was in France, she was enthralled by the majestic beauty of Marie Antoinette at Trianon, writing to her mother, Philadelphia Hancock, about the Queen's "Turkish dress at a ball, covered in diamonds, feathers, flowers, silver gauze, and jewels of all kinds".<sup>25</sup> Elizabeth also complained about the weight of her dress since she was "loaded with a great hoop of no inconsiderable weight", and court dresses were notorious for creating difficulty in carriages and sedan chairs.<sup>26</sup>

During the Reign of Terror, it became essential for aristocrats to get rid of their jewelry in a "desperate attempt to avoid la guillotine".<sup>27</sup> As the middle class loved semi-precious gemstones and imitations, the "market responded to this craving with a proliferation of imitation cameos and glass paste gems counterfeiting diamonds, emeralds, rubies, topazes, aventurine, and even opals".<sup>28</sup>

The Revolution targeted the rich; however, in The Ideology of the Aesthetic _(1990)_, Terry Eagleton argues that eighteenth-century middle-class aesthetics were far from emancipatory. It was "from the beginning a contradictory, double-edged concept". It highlighted "sensuous impulse and fellow-feeling" to legitimize their "new forms of autonomy and self-determination", revising "social relations on the basis of custom, affection, and sympathy". At the same time, these aesthetics signified an "internalized repression" that inserted "social power more deeply into the very body of those it subjugates" and so operat[ed] as "a supremely effective mode of political hegemony". The new standard of beauty reflected the "political unconscious" because the "beautiful is just political order lived out in the body".<sup>29</sup> It was fundamentally pro-establishment even though it directed followers to question the establishment.

Rousseau advocated the love of Nature and fashion au naturel as the embodiment of the longing for freedom. In the post-revolutionary era, the old regime's highly structured female costume—the conical, hooped silhouette with silk, velvet, lace, wigs, and petticoats—gave way to a Grecian look that emphasized a free-flowing, "natural", vertical silhouette with trains.<sup>30</sup> This fashion choice was a political response that sought to emulate an ancient democratic ideology. Unlike court fashion. Grecian gowns were less constricting than court attire because of their soft muslin fabric, low necklines, short puffy sleeves, and high waistlines, which idolized a pastoral profile.

Ironically, all things au naturel meant unfreedom on multiple levels. As men expected women to be blessed with "two balls of snow", flat-chested ladies felt the need to improve their busts by using false bosoms made of wax. In 1800, The True Briton reported that a father was surprised to learn that his daughter Euphrasia needed a "proper bosom" because the fourteen-year-old girl could not "appear in fashionable company with her present horrid flatness of chest". The drawback was that given "proper degrees of heat," these "waxen bosoms" frequently melted, thus women had to avoid candles or fire.<sup>31</sup>

</figure>

In 1813, Austen was glad that "the stays now are not made to force the Bosom up at all;—that was a very unbecoming, unnatural fashion" _(Letters 229)_. Stays refer to a foundation garment with wadding and whalebones. The Morning Herald recorded in the 1790s that a ladies bosom, "which Nature planted at the bottom of her chest, is pushed up by means of wadding and whalebone to a station so near her chin that in a very full subject, that feature is sometimes lost between the invading mounds".<sup>32</sup>

As a result, what seemed natural in fashion was anything but. Given that auburn and black hair had become in vogue, writing in The Lady's Magazine, Dr. John Cook offered a recipe for dying yellow hair. He mentioned that "[t]ime was when golden locks were looked upon as very beautiful", but "now the case is changed". Women with red hair "have the finest skins, with azure veins, and generally become the best breeders of the nation". If women wanted "agreeable black" hair, they could also use his homemade formula made of elderberries.<sup>33</sup>

Austen was far from impressed with the "natural" and "Grecian" look that adorned the many graceful ladies of Great Britain. Marie Antoinette was credited with popularizing the soft, underwear fashion known as "chemise à la Reine, or the ‘chemise in the style of the Queen'". This trend continued after the Queen's death, making the "lightweight fabric and its lack of undergarments" an iconic style designed to express the principles of "Neoclassicism and Seduction".<sup>34</sup> These flowing muslin gowns allowed women to show more skin, move more freely, and wear figure-revealing dresses made of delicate material. However, the thought of confusing undergarment fabric and outerwear material upset many.

In YYYY, The Times commented: "If the present fashion of nudity continues its career, the Milliners must give way to the Carvers, and the most elegant fig-leaves will be all the mode".<sup>35</sup> In 1801, Austen told her sister that she had "the satisfaction of estimating" Mrs. Powlett’s "Lace & her Muslin", whom she considered merely "expensively & nakedly dress’d". "Miss Langley is like any other short girl with a broad nose & wide mouth, fashionable dress, & exposed bosom" _(Letters 73, 89)_. Given the cold weather in the northern hemisphere, the diaphanous fabric brought illness to many, popularizing the so-called "muslin disease".

Due to sartorial change in France, the British look quickly became famous. In 1795, Nikolaus von Heideloff commended the achievements of British fashion in The Gallery of Fashion.

> In former times Greece was considered the first country in the world where the Fair Sex had acquired a superior taste in their vestments and every person of taste admired the elegant simplicity of their dresses. In our memory France has given her dresses to other nations; but it was reserved for the Graces of Great Britain to take the lead in Fashion and to show that if they do not surpass, they certainly equal the elegance of the most celebrated Grecian dresses. In short, beauty, shape, and taste are nowhere more general nor anywhere better united than in England.<sup>36</sup>

The tyranny of fashion soon became such that even though there was in-theory freedom of choice, no one embraced genuine freedom. In 1789, Maria Edgeworth declared that "taste is governed by arbitrary and variable laws; the fashion of dress, of decoration, of manner, change from day to day". It is preferable to retain an "open mind" because all one had to do was look at how the "sublime and beautiful vary at Pekin, at London, on Westminster bridge and the banks of the Ganges". Yet Edgeworth argued that trendsetters should be "accustomed to Grecian beauty, and to all the classic forms of grace".<sup>37</sup>

A popular magazine—Ackermann’s Repository of Arts—features fashion plates of men and women during the Regency period. Many costumes were original inventions by British tailors or high society women in Grecian styles. Contributors were sometimes credited: Mr. Barrry was a tailor and habit-maker. Mrs. Bean visited Paris and loved French dresses but moderated her "fancy" due to "a chaste feeling peculiar to herself". Mrs. Gill had "elegance of style, and judgment in adaptation", and her taste was "superior to most, and inferior to none!" Miss Pierpoint invented "the corset à la Grecque".<sup>38</sup>

The British fashion in Ackermann's Repository featured many items from international sources, demonstrating that trade, which was essential to expanding the British empire, supported dressiness. The magazine showcased French hats, Flemish bonnets, Egyptian headdresses of silver and pearls, Polish pelisses, Venetian spencers, French cloaks, Russian mantles, Spanish gauze, Indian muslin, Brussels lace, York tan gloves, French watches, diamond earrings, and Chinese parasols. In one of her letters, Austen mentions that she bought "some Japan" silk and would "begin my operations on my hat, on which you know my principal hopes of happiness depend" _(Letters 17)_.

In the nineteenth century, ladies wore multiple outfits for multiple occasions in a single day, such as morning wear, riding wear, and evening gowns. Additionally, "British" fashion quickly became associated with the worldwide sourcing of goods, dependable transportation networks, and international interactions.

In the name of branding British fashion, beauty standards converged with "expanding spaces for conflict, trade, and colonization" that allowed the nation to foster a national self-image with a fresh vision, against new revelations of the foreign and exotic, and created styles from this patchwork of sources that other nations nonetheless identified as 'English.'<sup>39</sup>

Although Adam Smith was a firm advocate of laissez-faire policies, Britain did not stand up for "freedom and democracy" in her interactions with other nations. The demand for lightweight fabric pushed England to support protective local and oppressive international economic practices. The East India Company was prohibited from importing and selling low-cost calico and chintz under the Calico Acts of 1700 and 1721, which were passed to defend British manufacturers. However, the law was soon removed in 1774, resulting in additional investments in mills. Although cotton increased national affluence, it also had a negative side. All ties to the French fashion industry were severed due to the Napoleonic Wars and the Revolutionary Period. This occurred at the same time as "increased trade with India, which imported the muslins, cashmere shawls, and the raw cotton to be processed by the rapidly growing numbers of mills appearing throughout the north of England."<sup>40</sup> Because of its accessibility, which made many Englishmen wealthy, muslin was considered democratic. The spinning apparatus was created by Richard Arkwright, who in 1769 received a patent for his creation. In Cromford, Derbyshire, he and his business partners established the first factory system, and further mills were constructed throughout England. He had 5,000 workers and £200,000 in the capital by 1782. He received a knighthood four years later.

Yet, Maxine Berg excerptribes how the East India Company monopolized and ultimately ruined the Indian muslin sector in Goods from the East, 1600-1800, when clientele shifted to the British market and traders wanted speedy production. It was challenging for Indian weavers to match desired production and quality (or else they would not be paid).<sup>41</sup> After Arkwright’s the spinning wheel was invented and the British mills were in full force, the English mills succeeded in mass-producing lightweight cotton that eventually replaced Indian muslin.

## Inequality

</figure>

The politics of "equality" also informed the nineteenth-century idea of beautiful trendsetters, who were fashionably sentimental and sympathetic, and a beautiful world. Young trendsetters popularized tears, fellow feeling, and mawkish sentimentality due to the influence of Goethe's Werther and Henry Mackenzie's man of feeling.

Dr. Johnson endorsed the love of moral sense and sympathy to strive for social justice. As a self-proclaimed anti-sentimentalist, he opened up his house to a group of retired prostitutes. However, he deemed social leveling too subversive and universal fellowship too dangerous for British society.<sup>42</sup> In Austen's eyes, there was a marked difference between moral sympathy and foolish sentimentality. To her, it is fallacious to pit the mind against the heart or to equate the beautiful mind of those with a heart with the rational mind of those with no heart.

In _"Love and Friendship"_, Austen ridiculed the fashionable idea that all humans are equal, justifying foolish love and marriage. She did not associate young friendship with the necessary love of "exalted Ideas, Delicate Feelings or refined Sensibilities", and was particularly harsh on those who championed the art of swooning or dissolving into tears. In the story, Edward chooses to marry Laura, a woman greatly beneath his social class, to defy social customs. To Sir Edward, his father, Edward defends his unequal marriage in this way: "Can you not conceive the Luxury of living in every Distress that Poverty can inflict, with the object of your tenderest Affection?" _(Minor Works 84)_ Edward journeys on to meet his good friend Augustus. When Laura meets Augustus' wife Sophia, the two ladies feel connected at once. Laura notes that the exchanged vows of "mutual Friendship" were too overwhelming "or the feelings of Sophia and myself—We fainted Alternately on a Sofa" _(Minor Works 86)_. Though Graham is a sensible man, Laura, and Sophia persuade their friend Janetta to reject him, noting that Graham does not look the part of a Romantic. He has "never read the sorrows of Werter, and that his Hair bore not the least resemblance to auburn." He must have "no soul" _(Minor Works 93)_. All these foolish marriages and friendships lead to family conflicts, deaths, and tragic outcomes.

In _Sense and Sensibility_, Marianne Dashwood takes pride in her overflowing emotions and her love of a "flushed cheek, hollow eye, and quick pulse of a fever" _(Sense and Sensibility 38)_. She strives to live up to her ideal of one love, but she utterly loses her beauty in the process. Her half-brother John makes the cruel comment that Marianne's "personal attractions" are "all gone," and she cannot "marry a man worth more than five or six hundred a -year, at the utmost" _(Sense and Sensibility 237)_. Her solitary walk in the rain even leads to a near-death experience.

Though the Romantic heart prioritizes powerful sensations, Edmund Burke famously highlights how humans perceive the sublime and the beautiful differently. What seems good aesthetically may not be good socially. In short, the sublime is awe-inspiring because it is associated with what is out of the ordinary and can overwhelm the senses and dumbfound the mind. What is unusual and spectacular may be good for the arts, but in reality, such events often mean threats, even terror, and the result is pain at the individual level and social upheaval at the collective level.<sup>43</sup> In the words of Terry Eagleton, the sublime is on the side of "rivalry and individuation: it is a phallic 'swelling' arising from our confrontation of danger." In his view, the sublime should be "outlawed by a state devoted to domestic peace" but found in a displaced form such as tragedies in the cultural sphere.<sup>44</sup> Simply put, the sublime is awe-inspiring and spectacular, good for the artistic domain, but it often destroys the existing social, psychological, physical, and natural equilibrium as it flouts the pleasure principle. Since transgressive power produces pain, suffering, terror, and chaos, the sublime is disruptive and restless and cannot contribute to domestic or social peace.

Beauty, on the other hand, is orderly, sensible, and excites love and affection. In the words of Burke,

> Those virtues which cause admiration, and are of the sublimer kind, produce terror rather than love. Such as fortitude, justice, wisdom, and the like. Never was any man amiable by force of these qualities. Those which engage our hearts, and impress us with a sense of loveliness, are the softer virtues; easiness of temper, compassion, kindness, and liberality.<sup>45</sup>

Burke further argues that "the beauty of women is considerably owing to their weakness or delicacy, and is even enhanced by their timidity, a quality of mind analogous to it."<sup>46</sup> Women may have external beauty, but the beautiful mind is linked to softer virtues.

Wollstonecraft promptly rejected the Burkean beauty myth. She also theorized the beauty of mind differently, and her view coincided with Austen’s critique of fashionable women that are "young, pretty, chattering, & thinking chiefly....of Dress, Company, Admiration" _(Letters 299)_.

To Wollstonecraft, the "conduct and manners of women, in fact, show clearly that their minds are not in a healthy state" because "strength and usefulness are sacrificed to beauty."<sup>47</sup> Female upbringing trains women to be "slaves" in a "political" and "civil" sense: "the girls’ limbs and faculties are cramped with worse-than-Chinese bands." They live a "sedentary life" in the private sphere; they glory in making conquests in public; they manipulate and trick men with their "sick delicacy", "false sentiments", and "over-stretched feelings" to enjoy power by proxy. They are taught that the gateway to success is beauty and fashion: "Taught from their infancy that beauty is woman’s scepter, the mind shapes itself to the body, and roaming around in its gilt cage it only seeks to adorn its prison."<sup>48</sup> Moreover, men instill in women their fear of the "unsexed" intellectual women.

> [A] German writer has shrewdly observed that a pretty woman is an object of desire for men of all excerptriptions, whereas a fine woman, who inspires more sublime emotions by displaying intellectual beauty, may have no attraction for men who find their happiness in the gratification of their appetites.<sup>49</sup>

Wollstonecraft embraced the inclusion of the intellect in a new concept of beauty. She opposed ageism by saying that "twenty the beauty of both sexes is equal;" it is masculine libertinism and coquettes who extol the virtues of youth and animal spirits. However, the beauty of mind—the "character of countenance"—is linked to the individuality of character and intellectual maturity. This is why the French give "preference to women of thirty. This means that they allow women to be in their most perfect state when vivacity gives way to reason and to the majestic seriousness of character which signifies maturity."<sup>50</sup> Burkean beauty is biased by age and gender: only males can have manly virtues such as fortitude, and humanity, reducing women to be mere objects of "trivial attentions."<sup>51</sup>

While the French Revolution promoted new ideas of brotherhood and fraternity, the outcome was anything but brotherly. The Reign of Terror rationalized the use of the guillotine in canceling the dominant hierarchy and enforced new aesthetics on the population. In short order, the revolutionaries justified plain fashions, with no silk, velvet, satin, corset, or hoops. Dark colors and cheap fabrics such as cotton became respectable in the early stage of the Revolution. As noted by Lynn Hunt, many were struck by "the court's insistence on different costumes for different orders: the deputies of the Third Estate were to wear somber black, while the nobles wore gold braiding, white hose, lace cravats, and gracious white plumes in their hats."<sup>52</sup> John Moore, a visitor to France, found the new dress code offensive: "In a short time a little black cloak on a brown thread-bare coat became respectable; and afterward when the cloaks were laid aside…a great plainness or rather shabbiness of dress was…considered as a presumption of patriotism."<sup>53</sup>

After 1792, the revolutionaries strove to cancel class differences and emphasized social equality. Politicians thus favored the short jacket _(known as the carmagnole)_, loose-fitting trousers, and even the "clogs of the sans-culottes, the urban popular classes."

Activists wore the iconic red Phrygian bonnet or liberty cap, the revolutionary national uniform, and "revealed the public meaning of a man's private character" to tone down social distinction.<sup>54</sup> Women abandoned their panniers and wore skirts that clung to the body, and the waist became short. Patriotic women wore royal blue, with a hat of black velvet, hatband, and tricolor cockade.

After the fall of Robespierre and the end of the Terror, less emphasis was placed on the civilian costume, even though official costume remained important.

In 1797, the Councils made the costumes of all deputies the same: “a ‘French’ coat of ‘national blue,’ a tricolor belt, a scarlet cloak à la grecque, and a velvet hat with tricolor aigrette.”<sup>55</sup> Expensive jewelry was best avoided. As Ernie Bradford notes, there was a “deliberate austerity and a paucity of jewelry display” because “the arts of luxury were the first to suffer at the hands of Equality.”<sup>56</sup> Consequently instead of diamonds, women wore guillotine earrings during the Reign of Terror.

However, new fashion codes could not cancel class sentiment. Distrust in the politics of fraternity and the republican regime soon gave rise to a resistant style that reverted to extreme frivolity, or what Alexander Fury calls “eighteenth-century Punk”,<sup>57</sup> especially after the fall of Robespierre. In the 1770s, the flamboyant court-centered French society welcomed exaggerated cosmetics and wigs, and men began to wear silk, satin, or velvet in bright colors, with lace cravats and cuffs, powdered hair, and perfume.

In the post-revolutionary era, excerptendants of aristocrats created new types of French dandies, styling themselves as Les Incroyables and Les Merveilleuses. In particular, Les Incroyables rejected the symbolic letter “r,” which stood for revolution, labeling themselves “Inc’oyables.” They strove not for an upright but a hunched posture and wore muddy coats with extremely wide lapels. Their collars were so high that they could bury both chin and jaw. Their extremely tight trousers came with ribbons just above the boots or leggings, and their bicorne hats could be flipped up front and back.

They often wore a pirate’s gold ring in one ear, and their hairstyle may sport elaborate sausage curls known as “dog ears,” while young trendsetters wore a guillotine haircut, or haircut à la victime, mimicking those who were to be executed.

Some incroyables were known as Muscadins due to their heavy use of musk perfume. Proud and angry, they wandered about with a cane or cudgel in hand to express punitive power and harass the revolutionary Jacobins.<sup>58</sup> Members of the “jeunesse dorée (gilded youth)” were devotees of flamboyant fashions, including high-tied cravats, wide lapels, and frock coats.

Meanwhile, the Merveilleuses label referred to their female counterparts, who defied social conventions and used fashion to critique revolutionary ideals and behavior codes. These ladies wore thin and diaphanous gowns, deliberately abandoning their chemises and petticoats.

Yet before this, British caricaturists such as Isaac Cruikshank and James Gillray had lost no time in ridiculing the provocative attire of these Parisian fashionistas.

In 1801, an elderly gentleman visited London and noted how all ladies—whether old or young, fat or slim—dressed in the same Grecian style. He wrote to the editor of The Lady’s Monthly Museum to complain about how “Grace had vanished at the command of Novelty, and Elegance had become a Gipsy in the struggle to make her fortune.”<sup>59</sup> Another short article entitled “Dialogue Between a Lady and A Man Milliner at Paris” satirized the “dare to bare” fashion in the following terms:

“Citizen, I am just come to town: – pray, have the goodness to inform me how I must appear, to be in the fashion.”
“Madame, ’tis done in a moment; in two minutes I shall equip you in the first style. – Have the goodness to take off that bonnet.”
“Well.”
“Off with that petticoat.”
“There it is.”
“Away with these pockets.”
“There they go.”
“Throw off that handkerchief.”
“’Tis done.”
“Away with that corset and sleeves.”
“Will that do?”
“Yes, Madame, you are now in the fashion. ‘Tis an easy matter, you see.–To be dressed in the fashion, you have only to undress.”<sup>60</sup>

The Macaronis were the frivolous ones in England, who were widely criticized throughout wartime. The Macaroni derived their name from the Macaroni Club, a group of stylish young Englishmen who had recently returned from the Grand Tour and had a passion for continental clothing, culture, and cuisine.

The Macaroni style exaggerated costumes, cosmetics, and hairstyles alike. The direct result was that the Tory administration attacked the macaronic style of the beau monde, fearing the corruptive influence of what Boyd Hilton calls “effeminate luxury.”<sup>61</sup> The indirect result was what psychologist John C. Flügel calls “The Great Masculine Renunciation” which impacts male fashion to this day.<sup>62</sup>

In the late eighteenth century, male fashion was linked to what Balzac calls the debate “between broadcloth and silk.”<sup>63</sup> Silks, white stockings, and buckle shoes were replaced by boots and riding coats, glorifying an active, faster lifestyle that came with activities such as riding, hunting, and shooting. Only male court clothing emphasized a fully dressed coat, without collar or lapels, made of silk, velvet, or richly embroidered cloth. The arrival on the scene of Beau Brummell marked the triumph of “English dandyism.” While french dandyism stood for rebellious flamboyance and provocation by those who championed living on the margins of society, English dandies also opposed the French Revolution and the Terror, but chose to reposition hegemonic gentlemanliness instead of being marginalized. Thus the triumph of “broadcloth” was backed by sound political and economic reasons. In 1795, to fund the army and defeat France, Pitt introduced or raised excise taxes.<sup>64</sup> As Pitt also taxed wig powder, the “rebellious Crops” wore their hair short and unpowdered, and these members “included some of the most elegant and politically prominent leaders of the anti-Pitt opposition.”<sup>65</sup>

George Bryan Brummell rose to great fame around this time because he created a style that signified “masculine renunciation.” He established the Regency gentleman’s dress code and became a friend of the Prince Regent.

His definitive look highlighted simplicity: “hat (when outdoors), shirt and collar, neckcloth, waistcloth, well-cut tail-coat, breeches, and top-boots, or pantaloons and Hessians.”<sup>66</sup> Lord Byron considered Brummell “the second most important man in Europe after Napoleon,” placing himself in third position.<sup>67</sup> The new way called for great cutting and fitting, but this “renunciation” went hand in hand with extreme frivolity and extravagance. Heels disappeared in the mid-1800s. Robert Dighton’s caricature shows Beau Brummell in glossy Hessian boots, pantaloons, or topboots and buckskins with a blue coat and a light or buff-colored waistcoat.

As a rule, Brummell shunned ornamentation and chose dark-colored coats. He declared that no one can be well-dressed if he is “too stiff, too tight, or too fashionable.” However, his idea of immaculate style means that his linen must be “whiter than white,” and he also invented straps to pass under the foot to hold the shape of his trousers.<sup>68</sup> Brummell is credited for being the first to starch and stiffen neckcloths, but neckcloths would be discarded if the cravat was not tied correctly for the first time. The perfect look means that Brummell wore a collar so large that, before being “folded down, it completely hid his head and face, and the white neckcloth was at least a foot in length.” His contemporary William Jesse recorded Brumell’s fastidiousness: “three coiffeurs were engaged to do his hair, one for the temples, one for the front, and the third for this occiput; his boots were cirées au vin de Champagne [polished with champagne], and the ties of his cravats designed by the first portrait painter in London.”<sup>69</sup> Catherine Gore, a writer of “silver fork novels” satirizing Regency high life, hints that Brummell—the son of a Private Secretary to Prime Minister Lord North and grandson of a valet to Lincolnshire politician Charles Monson—was a dandy, “a nobody, who made himself somebody and gave the law to everybody.”<sup>70</sup>

Jane Austen lived in the age of style. The Regency beauty myth embraced Grecian and classical ideals in response to the French Revolution, but ended up defending a kind of vainglorious elitism that advocated unfreedom, inequality, and frivolity. In principle, “polish or perish” became the watchword for fashion.

Austen was aware that fashion changed all the time and beauty could be skin deep, but if fashion and beauty were not allowed, what was left was—in the name of patriotism—only tyranny and brutality.
