Jane Austen loved food, but her reduced circumstances meant that she habitually transgressed between two totally different culinary domains. In 1798, the twenty-three old Jane told her sister Cassandra that “I am very fond of experimental housekeeping, such as having an ox-cheek now and then; I shall have one next week, and I mean to have some little dumplings put into it, that I may fancy myself at Godmersham” _(Letters 21)_. Having been adopted by Thomas and Catherine Knight of Godmersham, Kent, in 1794, her brother Edward inherited the house, and Jane regularly enjoyed fine food whenever she visited him.

From the very beginning, Austen manifested an Epicurean interest in fine food and stoicism toward homely food. She was aware of the futility of emulation: even though she aspired to be experimental in her housekeeping, her family could not afford a housekeeper, even less a team of professional cooks. As a result, she was all too aware of the differences between luxurious meals and ordinary foods: “In another week I shall be at home–& then, my having been at Godmersham will seem like a Dream, as my visit at Brompton seems already. The Orange Wine will want our Care soon.–But in the meantime for Elegance & Ease & Luxury–; the Hattons & Milles’ dine here today–& I shall eat Ice & drink French wine, & be above vulgar Economy” _(Letters 144)_. At some point, she stops and spares herself regrets because homely foods offer a different kind of enjoyment: “Luckily the pleasures of Friendship, of unreserved Conversation, of similarity of Taste & Opinions, will make good amends for Orange Wine” _(Letters 144)_.

In all fairness, the Austen family always had a cook, but they probably did not pay enough to get a very good cook. As a result, Jane was happy with a three-course meal in 1798. When Mr. Lyford visited the family, while at dinner. “he partook of our elegant entertainment. I was not ashamed at asking him to sit down to table, for we had some pease-soup, a sparerib, and a pudding” _(Letters 25)_. The family could not afford to be choosy, so they were willing to keep a cook with limited abilities: “Our dinner was very good yesterday, and the chicken boiled perfectly tender; therefore I shall not be obliged to dismiss Nanny on that account” _(Letters 17)_.

The death of Rev. George Austen in 1805 had serious financial repercussions on the life of the Austen women. In 1807, the food served at home became less enjoyable. “Our dinners have certainly suffered not a little by having only Molly’s head and Molly’s hands to conduct them; she fries better than she did, but not like Jenny.” Things became rather embarrassing when a visitor dined with the family. Captain Foote came “on Friday, and I fear will not soon venture again, for the strength of our dinner was a boiled leg of mutton, underdone even for James [Jane’s eldest brother]; and Captain Foote has a particular dislike to underdone mutton; but he was so good-humoured and pleasant that I did not much mind his being starved. He gives us all the most cordial invitation to his house in the country” _(Letters 120)_.

Over time, meat increasingly became a delicacy. In 1811, Austen noted that a chicken dish should be reserved for special occasions: “The chickens are all alive and fit for the table, but we save them for something grand” _(Letters 196)_. From 1811 to 1812, economic depression led to food riots. In 1813, Jane worried about the inflated price of meat in Kent while Cassandra was in Germany. She commented that “Rostock Market makes one’s mouth water, our cheapest Butcher’s meat is double the price of theirs;–nothing under 9d all this summer, & I beleive [sic] upon recollection nothing under 10d.–Bread has sunk & is likely to sink more, which we hope may make Meat sink too” _(Letters 239)_.
Austen lived a very different life when she went to Kent or London visiting her brothers. In her eyes, Kent “is the only place for happiness. Everybody is rich there;–I must do similar justice however to the Windsor neighborhood” _(Letters 29)_. When she visited her banker brother Henry, she was treated to an ordinary five-course family dinner in 1813. “Mde. Bigeon was dressing us a most comfortable dinner of soup, fish, bouillee, partridges, and an apple tart, which we sat down to soon after five, after cleaning and dressing ourselves” _(Letters 227)_.

It was impossible not to note how the dinner hour differed between country and town. In Austen’s time, dinner commonly took place between 3 and 5pm, but country dinners tended to take place earlier. In Sense and Sensibility, the Middletons eat at 4pm, and the family at Mansfield Parsonage sit down to a meal at 4:30pm. When Mrs Jennings goes to London, dinner begins at 5pm, and Miss Bingley prefers to dine at 6:30pm in Pride and Prejudice. In 1798, while her sister Cassandra was away, and Jane was staying with her parents in Steventon in Hampshire: “We dine now at half after Three, & have done dinner I suppose before you begin–We drink tea at half after six.–I am afraid you will despise us” _(Letters 28)_. In Kent, she dined past four. When Jane visited Frank’s family in Southampton, she reported that she “never dine[d] now till five” _(Letters 164)_. In London, Henry made his family dine at half past four or five and then took them to a Musical or a play in the evening, and they were home again by 10. If Henry hosted a party, dinner was at half past five, and on one occasion, the party ended at midnight.
Jane’s preference indicates her adaptability. In 1800, she reports that she likes “Gooseberry pie and Gooseberry pudding very much” _(Letters 50)_. In 1808, she tells her sister, “You know how interesting the purchase of a spongecake is to me” _(Letters 133)_. Yet she does not forget homely foods. To Cassandra, she insists on receiving the latest information: “Let me know when you begin the new Tea–& the new white wine.–My present Elegancies have not yet made me indifferent to such Matters” _(Letters 232)_.

Overcompensation may have been an issue when Jane had to cross two different food worlds due to family obligations or other reasons. She tried not to indulge herself when she was young. In 1796, the image-conscious Austen was alarmed by the company of female drinkers: “If the Pearsons were not at home, I should inevitably fall a Sacrifice to the arts of some fat Woman who would make me drunk with Small Beer” _(Letters 12)_. In 1813, Jane Austen was thirty-eight years old. She told Cassandra that she no longer had scruples about drinking: “As I must leave off being young, I find many Douceurs in being a sort of Chaperon for I am put on the Sofa near the Fire & can drink as much wine as I like” _(Letters 261)_. In 1800, Austen already sensed that her indulgence might impact her health: “I beleive [sic] I drank too much wine last night at Hurstbourne; I know not how else to account for the shaking of my hand today” _(Letters 62)_.

Jane Austen died in July 1817. In January of the same year, she was still interested in orange wine. She wrote to her wealthy friend Alethea Bigg: “The real object of this letter is to ask you for a receipt, but I thought it genteel not to let it appear early. We remember some excellent orange wine at Manydown, made from Seville oranges, entirely or chiefly & should be very much obliged to you for the receipt, if you can command it within a few weeks _(Letters 342)_.

What the Austens did with the receipt or the orange wine remained a mystery. The significance is that, with a little help, Jane Austen could taste niceties in her own home, even though her double life remained unchanged.
