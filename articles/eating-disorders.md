In 1807, The Lady’s Magazine reported under the section of “Home News” that a woman could not stop eating after giving birth.

> July 12. A few weeks since the wife of a laborer, after being brought to bed and safely delivered, was seized with an insatiable appetite for food. Her husband being incapable of supporting her unnatural craving, obtained admission for her into St. Bartholomew’s hospital, where she remains at present in a most dreadful situation. She eats incessantly and is supplied with three pounds of beef, a quartern loaf, and a proportionable quantity of drink. On one occasion the surgeons ordered her to be kept without eating for one hour, and the consequence was, she raised the most shocking cries until her craving was satisfied. She retains her senses, and constantly requests those about her to bear with her unnatural behavior until she is cured by medical assistance, or death puts an end to her sufferings. Previous to this singular propensity, the unfortunate woman was known to be a very moderate eater.
