Beau Brummell was known as the arbiter elegantarium of Regency London—the “judge of propriety” in taste and manners.<sup>1</sup> He used the principles of harmony of shape and contrast of colours with such pleasing results that men of superior rank sought his opinion on their own dress.<sup>2</sup> Brummell is widely acknowledged as inventing the prototype of the modern men’s suit and inventing dandyism, solidifying the physical boundaries and reputation of London as the centre of gentlemanly style for centuries to come. Yet Brummell’s biographer Ian Kelly notes, “Brummell was renowned as a metropolitan wit before his personal style was copied by Londoners, Parisians and thence by urbane men the world over”.<sup>3</sup>

## Dandyism

Dandyism was not just a fashion statement, but rather an aesthetic that placed high importance on physical appearance and refined culture while maintaining an attitude of wit and nonchalance. In other words, an imitation of an aristocratic lifestyle. Ellen Moers comments that “The Brummell style … was suitable for all classes and occupations. Hardly altered in essentials, it would clothe democracy”.<sup>4</sup>

## Dandyism- Fashion

The Beau’s manner of distinction lay in the perfection of cut which provided him, as Kelly writes, with “arrestingly body-formed clothing”.<sup>3</sup> Through collaboration with his tailors, Brummell sculpted the basic woollen coat from something leaden and stiff into a carefully shaped and padded simulacrum of the lithe neo-classical male torso. The contrast of shiny black boots, skin-tight buff breeches, and the shapely navy coat was crowned at the neck by the whimsical burst of a white linen cravat. For jewellery, he possessed one plain ring and a watch chain of “Venetian ducat gold” in an unusual design of which he only ever showed two links.<sup>5</sup> He also owned an enviable collection of accessories such as canes (some carved with caricatures of the heads of noted members of society) and snuffboxes, claiming to possess a different one for each day of the year.<sup>3</sup>

Brummell remains most famous for his morning dress, which was a combination of country sportswear and military details borrowed from his time as an officer of the 10th Hussars in Brighton.<sup>1</sup> Jesse writes that his dress “was similar to that of every other gentleman—Hessians and pantaloons, or topboots and buckskins, with a blue coat, and a light or buff-coloured waistcoat; of course fitting to admiration, on the best figure in England”.<sup>5</sup>

## Dandyism- Attitude

Brumell placed high importance and standards on appearance. He claims that it takes him five hours a day to dress and recommends boots be polished with champagne.<sup>6</sup> He was once asked how much it would cost to keep a man in clothes, he said “Why, with a tolerable economy, I think it might be done with £800”.<sup>7</sup>

Brummell's influence went as far as shaping the lifestyle of aristocrats. For example, Brumell influenced the upper echelons of society to pay personal attention to their cleanliness through his own personal habits, such as cleaning his teeth, shaving, and daily bathing.

## Introduction

Brummell was educated at Eton and made his precocious mark on fashion when he not only modernised the white stock, or cravat, that was the mark of the Eton boy but added a gold buckle to it.<sup>2</sup>
He progressed to Oxford University, where, by his own example, he made cotton stockings and dingy cravats a thing of the past. He left the university after only a year, at the age of sixteen for the military, where he met George IV, the Prince of Wales.
Brummell's friendship with, and influence over, the Prince of Wales continued after the military. He became the arbiter of fashion and established a mode of dress that rejected overly ornate clothes in favour of understated but perfectly fitted and tailored bespoke garments. This look was based on dark coats, full-length trousers rather than knee breeches and stockings, and above all, immaculate shirt linen and an elaborately knotted cravat.<sup>8</sup>

## Downfall

Brummell's wealthy friends influenced him; he began spending and gambling as though his fortune were as ample as theirs. He found it increasingly difficult to maintain his lifestyle, but his prominent position in society allowed him to float a line of credit.

In July 1813, at a masquerade ball jointly hosted at Watier's private club by Brummell, Lord Alvanley, Henry Mildmay and Henry Pierrepont. The four were considered the prime movers of Watier's, dubbed "the Dandy Club" by Byron. The Prince Regent greeted Alvanley and Pierrepont at the event, and then "cut" Brummell and Mildmay by staring at their faces without speaking.<sup>9</sup> This provoked Brummell's remark, "Alvanley, who's your fat friend?".

The incident marked the final breach in a rift between Brummell and the Prince that had opened in 1811 when the Prince became Regent and began abandoning all his old Whig friends.<sup>10</sup> Brummell became an anomalous favourite flourishing without a patron, influencing fashion and courted by a large segment of society.<sup>3</sup>

In 1816, Brummell, owing thousands of pounds, fled to France to escape the debtor's prison. Usually, Brummell's gambling obligations, being "debts of honour", were paid immediately. The one exception to that was his final wager, dated March 1815 in White's betting book, which was marked "not paid, 20th January 1816".<sup>11</sup>

He lived the remainder of his life in French exile, spending ten years in Calais without an official passport. Rapidly running out of money and growing increasingly slovenly in his dress, his long-unpaid Calais creditors forced him into debtors' prison in 1835. Only through the charitable intervention of his friends in England was he able to secure his release later that year. In 1840, Brummell died at the age of 61, penniless and insane from syphilis, at Le Bon Sauveur Asylum on the outskirts of Caen. He is buried at Cimetière Protestant, Caen, France.<sup>12</sup>
