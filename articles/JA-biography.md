<!-- @format -->

Jane Austen was a renowned English author best known for her portrayals and commentaries on middle-class life in early 19th-century England and her sardonic writing style. Specifically, Austen explored marriage, social standing, and economic security, especially for women. Even though her fame rose several years after she passed away, her works continue to source countless critical essays and movies.

Overall she has published six novels: _Sense and Sensibility_ (1811), _Pride and Prejudice_ (1813), _Mansfield Park_ (1814), _Emma_ (1815), and _Northanger Abbey_ and _Persuasion_ (1818) posthumously. She left behind unfinished novels _Sanction_, _The Watsons_, and _Lady Susan_, as well as three unpublished volumes of juvenile works.

## Childhood and Family

Jane Austen was born on December 16, 1775, into an eight-person household in the Hampshire village of Steventon, England. Despite the large family size, the family's financial situation was stable due to Mr. Austen's cumulative income from working in the rectory, farming, and teaching three or four boys at a time.<sup>1</sup>

Jane's home life was close-knitted, engaging, and jovial. Park Honan, Jane Austen's Biographer, recorded an “open, amused, easy intellectual” atmosphere in the home, encouraging the Austens to evaluate and discuss opposing viewpoints with an open mind.<sup>2</sup> The first records of Jane appear in family documents excerptribing her return, ”... and almost home they were when they met Jane & Charles, the two little ones of the family, who had to go as far as New Down to meet the chaise, & have the pleasure of riding home in it.”<sup>3</sup> Jane's activities included attending church, reading books, and interacting with her friends and neighbors. As her brother, Henry remarks, “Jane was fond of dancing and excelled in it”<sup>4</sup>, whether it was spontaneous after dinner in someone's home, or at the regular balls hosted in the town hall's assembly rooms.<sup>5</sup>

In hindsight, “Mr. Austen's predictions for his younger daughter were fully justified. Never were sisters more to each other than Cassandra and Jane; while in a particularly affectionate family, there seems to have been a special link between Cassandra and Edward on the one hand, and between Henry and Jane on the other.”<sup>6</sup>

## Education and development in literature

The family made several attempts to provide for Jane and Cassandra to receive formal education. However, circumstances such as catching the fatal fever Typhus<sup>7</sup> and exorbitant tuition costs, Jane and Cassandra continued to be home-schooled.

Nevertheless, Jane's family enthusiastically influenced and supported her development as a writer, despite the widespread perception in society that women who wanted to be full-time writers were believed to be demeaning their femininity.<sup>8</sup> Performing private comedic theatrics was The Austen's favorite pastime, which played a hand in cultivating Jane's satirical humor. Mr. Austen was also Jane's biggest advocate. With his contacts with the church, he not only had access to a sizable library, but he also offered her his books, writing implements, and other equipment so the girls could express themselves creatively.<sup>9</sup> This is further demonstrated by the fact that Mr. Austen unsuccessfully tried to have Jane's early manuscripts of _Pride and Prejudice_ published as soon as she shared them with the family.<sup>10</sup>

When Jane turned 12 years old, she started developing her writing through exaggerated stories and poetry about everyday life and parodying “stories [] full of anarchic fantasies of female power, licence, illicit behaviour, and general high spirits”.<sup>11</sup> This later became a three-volume collection called Juvenilia, which helped developed her first satirical novel Love and Freindship [sic]. She continued writing in her teen years, developing works such as Catharine or the Bower and Sir Charles Grandison or the happy Man, a comedy in 6 acts.

By adulthood, she composed _Lady Susan_, a novella written as a sequence of letters. It was considered her most ambitious and complex early work.<sup>12</sup> The heroine, according to Claire Tomalin, a biographer of Jane Austen, is a sexual predator who manipulates, betrays, and mistreats her lovers, friends, and family.

> Told in letters, it is as neatly plotted as a play, and as cynical in tone as any of the most outrageous of the Restoration dramatists who may have provided some of her inspiration ... It stands alone in Austen's work as a study of an adult woman whose intelligence and force of character are greater than those of anyone she encounters.<sup>13</sup>

Eliza de Feuillide, Jane's cousin and sister-in-law, may have served as inspiration for the main character, as she shared stories about her glamorous lifestyle and countless adventures with Jane.<sup>11</sup> Additionally, she recounted the execution of her ex-husband, which left Jane with a lasting impression of the atrocities of the French Revolution.<sup>14</sup>

## Unrequited love: Tom Lefroy

According to Jane, Tom Lefroy was a “very gentlemanlike, good-looking, pleasant young man”<sup>15</sup>. He was visiting Steventon as a barrister-in-training and hit it off with Jane at a ball or gathering. She has written to Cassandra:

> I am almost afraid to tell you how my Irish friend and I behaved. Imagine to yourself everything most profligate and shocking in the way of dancing and sitting down together.<sup>16</sup>

Five days later,

> I will confide myself in the future to Mr Tom Lefroy, for whom I don't give a sixpence.<sup>15</sup>

and on the very next day,

> The day will come on which I flirt my last with Tom Lefroy and when you receive this it will be all over. My tears flow as I write at this melancholy idea.<sup>15</sup>

Because Tom was financially dependent on his family, the Lefroy family discouraged Tom from getting married. Hence they stepped in to prevent Tom from seeing Jane ever again.<sup>17</sup> Jane may have kept her satirical tones towards romance through her letters. However, it was clear that she was attracted to Lefroy.<sup>15</sup>

In 1802, Jane received a marriage proposal from her childhood friend Harris Bigg-Wither. Although marriage would have brought financial stability to her family, Austen declined him as she was not attracted to him.<sup>18</sup>

## The development of great works

Upon completing _Lady Susan_, Jane Austen planted the seeds for numerous great works between 1796 and 1798. Over two years, she began interleaving her writing time between _Sense and Sensibility_ (originally titled _Elinor and Marianne_) and _Pride and Prejudice_ (originally titled _First Impressions_), before devoting herself to _Susan_ (later renamed _Northanger Abbey_) and completing its draft within a year.<sup>19</sup>. In 1803, Henry Austen presented _Susan_ to a London publisher who promised to release it. However, the work remained unpublished and was eventually reacquired in 1816.<sup>20</sup>

## Unstable personal life

Jane's writing momentum stalled after around 1800. She had never expressed clearly any reasons that prevented her from writing, however, Jane was probably settling into her new life in Bath around this time.

During this period, _The Watsons_ began to take shape.<sup>21</sup> The plot revolves around an ill and destitute pastor with his four unmarried daughters, which heavily reflected The Austen’s financial dependence on Mr. Austen.

Unfortunately, Mr. Austen died five years later. Jane dropped _The Watsons_ <sup>22</sup> and the Austen women moved frequently due to financial insecurity until 1809 when they settled in Chawton.<sup>23</sup> Her niece Anna excerptribed the family's life in Chawton as "a very quiet life, according to our ideas, but they were great readers, and besides the housekeeping our aunts occupied themselves in working with the poor and in teaching some girl or boy to read or write."<sup>24</sup>

## Publications

Chawton proved to be the place where Austen regained her writing momentum and published four remarkable novels. Due to her prior encounter with publishing Susan through copyright, Austen adopted a new approach to publishing her works, known as “on commission”. Here, the publishers would finance the production costs upfront and recoup the expenses from sales proceeds, while also charging a commission of 10% on every book sold. The remainder of the profits would go to the author. Thus, in case the revenue from sales failed to cover the expenses incurred, the author would be held responsible for the outstanding amount.<sup>25</sup>

_Sense and Sensibility_ was published in 1811 “By a Lady”. It earned favorable reviews and drew a large number of young aristocratic opinion-makers, selling out in 1813.<sup>26</sup> This was important because it allowed Austen to finally achieve financial freedom. Readers continued to enjoy Austen's books, which were labeled "By the author of _Sense and Sensibility_." When _Pride and Prejudice_ was released in 1813, it received three very favorable reviews. The best-selling book up until that point, _Mansfield Park_, was released in 1814. <sup>27</sup> Austen began a second edition with _Mansfield Park_, which sold poorly, after _Emma_'s 1815 publication.

## Austen’s last years

1816 marked the beginning of poor fortune. Despite the fact that Austen had several more publications in the works, including Susan and the developing _The Elliots_ (which was subsequently published as _Persuasion_), Henry Austen's bank failed, putting the family in debt.<sup>28</sup> Austen was also beginning to feel ill, which was the beginning of her health failing.<sup>29</sup>

Before she put her pen down, Jane Austen continued to write, finishing _The Elliots_ and beginning _The Brothers_ (later known as _Sanditon_), before experiencing great pain and welcoming death in 1817 at age 41.<sup>30</sup>

Jane Austen's family continued to support her in her writing endeavors even after her death. _Persuasion_ and _Northanger Abbey_ were published together, along with a biographical note written by Cassandra.
