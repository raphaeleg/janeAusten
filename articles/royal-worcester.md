One of the oldest English porcelain manufacturers still in operation, Royal Worcester was founded in Worcester in 1751. It was discovered thanks to the work of chemist Dr. John Wall and pharmacist William Davis, who used soaprock<sup>2</sup> in earlier experiments to create a substance that resembled porcelain. <sup>1</sup> Their creation was kept secret to the point where anyone who revealed how it was done would have to pay £4000. <sup>1</sup>

## Craftsmanship specialty

They experimented some more, trying to imitate a simple character's blue and white Nankin patterns.<sup>2</sup> A breakthrough occurred around 1755 when Worcester started making blue and white porcelain teapots that were both affordable for the middle class and sturdy enough to hold boiling water. <sup>1</sup> Worcester kept honing its craft throughout the rest of the 18th century by using transfer printing, engraving, and copying well-known styles like Rococo and Oriental, Meissen, Underglaze blue backgrounds, Japanese Imari, and more. <sup>1</sup>

## Financial Decline

Dr. Walls' death in 1776 marked the beginning of the end for Worcester productions. <sup>2</sup> Despite this, George III granted the "Royal Porcelain Works" a royal warrant. The first apprentice in Worcester, Robert Chamberlain, started his own company, Chamberlain's Factory, to carry on Worcester's traditions. This venture was quite successful, and in 1811, the Prince Regent granted it a royal warrant. <sup>3</sup>
Chamberlains' decorative depictions of country homes and people from well-known paintings or plays, such as scenes from Shakespeare's plays <sup>3</sup> or debased Japanese style were among his best-known creations. <sup>4</sup>
The original Worcester company and Chamberlain's Factory eventually merged to form Chamberlain & Company in the 1840s. They specialized in producing buttons, porcelain door decor, and old-world encaustic floor tiles for churches that were being renovated. <sup>3</sup>

## Blush Ivory Porcelain

In the 1890s, Royal Worcester created porcelain with organic shapes like shell dishes and baskets and natural materials like coral-handled jugs, which were influenced by the Art Nouveau movement. <sup>5</sup> This was so well-liked that imitations of it were sold, forcing Royal Worcester off the market. <sup>2</sup>
