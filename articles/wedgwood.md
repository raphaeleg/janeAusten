“Timeless Eclecticism since 1759” The Wedgwood company strongly adheres to the principles of its founder, Josiah Wedgwood I, who is regarded as the "Father of English Potters" and was instrumental in bringing the production of European ceramics into the industrial age.<sup>1</sup> Wedgwood explored more with the artistic potential of clay than other pottery enterprises at the period, becoming a trendsetter brand. Hence, Wedgwood became the birthplace of many important materials such as Jasper, Queen's Ware and Black Basalt.<sup>2</sup>

## Jasperware

The most well-known piece of Wedgwood pottery, Jasperware, was created in 1774 after countless attempts. It was a type of matte-finished, unglazed stoneware that was primarily intended for sculpting and display rather than serving food.<sup>2</sup> There are other colours of Jasperware finishes, but the recognizable Wedgwood blue is the most recognizable as Wedgwood's trademark.<sup>3</sup>

## Queen’s Ware

Queen Charlotte was the first monarch to whom Wedgwood's creations appealed to. Her very first purchase was a set of pottery that was cream in colour. Because of this, Josiah Wedgwood's creamware was referred to as "Queen's Ware" and his pottery as "Potter to Her Majesty" because of its superior craftsmanship and aesthetic appeal.<sup>1</sup> Since acquiring the Royal Warrant in 1995, Wedgwood items have proudly dwelt in British royal homes. <sup>1</sup>

## Black Basalt

“The Black is sterling, & will last for ever.” Black Basalt, a fine-grained stoneware that first appeared in 1768, got its colours from the addition of manganese and carr obtained from coal mines.<sup>4</sup> Wedgwood transformed this material's use from domestic items to a more artisanal approach, creating at least 100 breathtaking decorative sculptures of important individuals.<sup>5</sup>
