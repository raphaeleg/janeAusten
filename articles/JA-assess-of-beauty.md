It is a truth universally acknowledged that many men judge women by way of norm referencing, while women rank women on the basis of criterion referencing. The difference between the two is obvious: the former emphasizes relative judgment, the latter depends on absolute standards. Norm - referenced evaluation entertains no absolute ideas; the environment defines what counts as the “norm,” and people are deemed outstanding as long as they stand out from the rest. In contrast, criterion referencing highlights the assessor’s absolute standards. These standards may be subjective or objective, but the assessor is not swayed by circumstantial factors. Jane Bennet likes Mr Bingley because he is “what a young man ought to be.” Her “oughts” imply a set of criteria that emphasizes sense, agreeable personality, and gentlemanly behavior. Bingley fits the bill because he is “sensible, good - humoured, lively,” and she has never seen “such happy manners! —so much ease, with such perfect good breeding” _( PP 14 )_.<sup>1</sup>

The difference between Charles Bingley and his sister is another case in point. Charles attends a public assembly in Hertfordshire, and his comment on women is this: “I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty.” Jane Bennet catches his eye because she is “the most beautiful creature” he has ever beheld _( PP 11 )_. In contrast, Caroline Bingley relies on criterion - referenced judgment and rates women according to their facial features, skin complexion, body figure, style, manners, fashion, and accomplishments. Beautiful women are very rare because of the range of assessed areas, and few can excel in so many categories. In fact, not many women can excel in even one. To Caroline, Elizabeth fails _totally_.

> I never could see any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose wants character—there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, I could never see anything extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not like at all; and in her air altogether there is a self - sufficiency without fashion, which is intolerable _( PP 271 )._

Caroline’s standard also implies that Elizabeth scores poorly in one particular category—cultural accomplishments. This category includes specific achievements (cultural performance) as well as generic excellence( the art of femininity ), emphasizing personal abilities, style, and performance. In short,

> [an accomplished] woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but half - deserved _( PP 39 )._

High standards offer useful reference points, but if the bar is raised too high, the judge is setting up the observed to fail. This amounts to psychological bullying when subjects are criticized due to the assessor’s unrealistic expectations. Elizabeth Bennet protests against Caroline’s criteria and implies that sound assessment should highlight validity, reliability, fairness, practically, and efficiency. Caroline and Darcy propose inhuman standards that can be unfair, impractical, and over - exacting. Elizabeth says that she “never saw such a woman” with “such capacity, and taste, and application, and elegance” united _( PP 39 )_.

Elizabeth is also interested in criterion - referencing, but her judgment is flawed due to her limited scope of assessment. She highlights physical and social or moral categories such as good looks, good manners, and likeable personality. People should have a high degree of agreeableness, “sweetness and disinterestedness” in addition to “good sense,” “affectation of candour,” and candidness “without ostentation or design” _( PP 134, 14 )_. Jane is therefore an angel in her eyes. Elizabeth does not overvalue categories such as good birth, education, or money. As a result, she is “very little disposed to approve” of the Bingley women even though two are “rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town,” have “a fortune of twenty thousand pounds,” are “in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people of rank” _( PP 15 )_. Elizabeth is right in her disapproval of the Bingley sisters, but she is less lucky in her approval of Mr Wickham. Wickham fits her bill and wins her favor because he is agreeable, candid, and has a fine air. However, Mrs Gardiner reminds her that though Wickham may be an interesting young man, his lack of fortune means that he should not be taken as a model of attractiveness. Elizabeth reluctantly agrees with her aunt, only to witness how Wickham’s agreeableness is a cunning tactic that almost destroys her family.

_Pride and Prejudice_ is a comedy because psychological bullies must be subdued and erroneous judgment corrected. Mr Darcy is a stout defender of criterion referencing. At the Longbourn assembly, he sees “a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too much.” Elizabeth Bennet is “tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt” him due to the “inferiority of her connections” and “condition of life” _( PP 16, 192 )_. Elizabeth is aware of his strict standards and thereafter talks to Darcy only to ridicule his supposed objective criteria, noting that he only “means to be severe on” the female sex. Yet her witty banter arouses his attention, and Darcy gradually relaxes his standard because he is smitten by Elizabeth’s “fine eyes.” As he shifts to emphasize one (subjective) criterion, he shares his new perspective with Miss Bingley. His mind is “agreeably engaged” because he has been “meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.” Moreover, Elizabeth’s fine eyes are “brightened by the exercise” of walking three miles from Longbourn to Netherfield Park _( PP 27, 36 )_.

The final joke is on Darcy because his “impartial” assessment turns out to be fairly arbitrary. In the story, Mr Collins admires Elizabeth’s wit and vivacity, butno one but Darcy is struck by Elizabeth’s “fine eyes.” Beauty is an intersectional concept that foregrounds the powers of lookism, sexism, individual mannerism, familism, classism, culturalism, ageism, racism, and nationalism. Still, where there is love, there is new beauty in the eyes of the beholder.
