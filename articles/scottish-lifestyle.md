In May 1807, The Lady’s Magazine published “On the Progress of Society and Manners in Scotland” and outlined the differences between the 1760s and 1800s.

1760s
In the early 18th century, entertainment—music, dance, theater, public cock-fighting, wine—did not go down well with rigid Presbyterianism. trendsetters dined at two. Concerts began at six and “the performance was over at an early hour. The morality of stage plays was at this time much agitated, and several of the clergy were censured for attending the theatre.” (262). Dancing in public assemblies began at six and ended at eleven. There was “strict regularity with respect to dress and decorum, and great dignity of manners were observed” (262).
On the other hand, religion played a significant role in 1763. Home and church worship were frequent, involving both masters and servants.

> The clergy visited, catechized, and instructed the families within their respective parishes in the principles of morality, Christianity, and the relative duties of life. The breach of the seventh commandment was punished by a fine and church censure. Any instance of conjugal infidelity in a woman would have banished her irretrievably from society, and her company would have been rejected even by men who paid any regard to their character. The number of abandoned females was very small. Housebreaking and robbery were extremely rare, and many trendsetters thought it unnecessary to lock their doors at night. The execution of criminals in Edinburgh for capital crimes was rare, and three annually were reckoned the average for the whole kingdom of Scotland. For many years in Edinburgh, there was no execution. (261)

Scottish ladies were raised to be beautiful and useful. They attended sewing school and pastry school, and wealthy young ladies went to “market with her mother” and they were not afraid to go out by themselves and walk “through the streets of the city in perfect safety at any hour.” (262)

On the other hand, a Scottish gentleman “was termed a fine fellow who to a well-informed and accomplished mind added elegance of manners, and a conduct guided by principle.” He did not oppress the poor, nor did he contract debts. He strove to be useful and breached no moral codes.

Many trendsetters used sedan chairs to commute between locations. The gentry and peerage purchased carriages from London in the 1760s; no coaches were produced in Edinburgh. In the Scottish capital, there were only “two stage-coaches to the town of Leith; and the only other in the Scottish capital was one to London, which set off once a month.” There weren't many hackney carriages, and they were “perhaps, the worst of the kind in Britain.” Visitors to Edinburgh had to live in uncomfortably furnished hotels or private homes. The phrase “There was no such place as a hotel” and “the word, indeed, was not known, or was only intelligible to persons acquainted with the French, and there was no hotel”(263) were both true.

The spirit of the times signaled decorum or “formality,” dignity or “affected gravity,” prudence and propriety, or “a sanctimonious preciseness and regularity” (263).

1780s
Twenty years later, trendsetters yearned for the pleasures of life, heavily neglecting religion. Sunday was now a day to unwind as trendsetters dined at five and had long dinners.

> “[P]eople of fashion and of middle rank dined at four or five o'clock; no business was done in the afternoon, dinner of itself having become a very serious matter. Every tradesman in decent circumstances presented wine after dinner, and many in plenty and variety. At this time the drawing-rooms were totally deserted; invitations to tea in the afternoon were given up; and the only opportunity gentlemen had of being in the company of the ladies, was when they happened to mess together at dinner or supper, and even then an impatience was sometimes shewn till the ladies retired. Card parties after a long dinner, and also after a late supper, were frequent” (264).

The definition of a gentleman has also evolved: The “company of the ladies is also, as in 1783, much neglected; and the bottle is preferred to the amusements of the drawing-room” (266).

> A young man at this time was termed a fine fellow, who could drink three bottles of wine; who discharged all debts of honour (game debts and tavern bills), and evaded payment of every other; who swore immoderately, and before ladies, and talked of his word of honour; who ridiculed religion and morality as folly and hypocrisy (but without argument); who was very jolly at the table of his friend, and would lose no opportunity of seducing his wife, or of debauching his daughter; but, on the mention of such a thing being attempted to his own connections, would have cut the throat or blown out the brains of his dearest companion offering such an insult; who was forward in all the fashionable follies of the time; who disregarded the interests of society, or the good of mankind, if they interfered with his own vicious selfish pursuits and pleasures.” (264-5)

Women were educated to endorse ornamental womanliness and accept limited mobility.

> The daughters of many tradesmen consumed their mornings at the toilette, or in strolling from shop to shop, &c. Many of them would have blushed to have been seen in a market. The cares of the family were devolved upon a housekeeper, and a young lady employed those heavy hours when she was disengaged from public or private amusements in improving her mind from the precious stores of a circulating library; and all, whether they had taste for it or not, were taught music. Such was the danger at this time to which unprotected females were exposed, that the mistresses of boarding-schools found it necessary to advertise that their young ladies were not permitted to go abroad without proper attendants.” (265)
> At the same time, maid-servants dressed “as fine as their mistresses did.” Almost “every genteel family had a man-servant; and the wages were from ten pounds to twenty pounds a year” (265).

Yet trendsetters craved entertainment. Public assemblies began at seven or eight, and the lady directress sometimes showed up at ten. “The young masters and misses, who would have been mortified not to have seen out the ball, thus returned home at three or four in the morning, and yawned, and gaped, and complained of headaches all the next day.” (265). Along with an increase in the number of separations and divorces, public cockfighting contests, prostitution, alcoholism, criminality, and disorderly conduct, all became commonplace.

Additionally, trendsetters enjoyed traveling. Local businesses produced chaises and coaches as stagecoaches tripled in number. The “accommodation of the inhabitants of Edinburgh was splendid, and the houses in the New Town unrivalled in elegance” (265).

1800s
The 1800s were an era of improvement. Men were taught to enjoy athletics and simple manners. They had a variety of interests, but they disliked crude entertainment. “Public cock-fighting matches are now nearly given up in the city” (267).

> Of the fine fellow of 1803, it is difficult to strike the peculiar likeness. Less accomplished than those of 1763, and without many of the vices of those of 1783, the fine fellow of the present day is rather an object of laughter than censure, of pity rather than approbation. He can drive a coach full of ladies equal to the most experienced coachman, does not often overturn the carriage, and very seldom rides down old trendsetters or children. As a genealogist he equals the Highlander or Welshman; can trace the pedigree of Goldfinder through a hundred excerptents, and enumerate all the dams, grand-dams, and great-grand-dams, with the most fluent accuracy. He is a skillful physiognomist; can tell the good or bad qualities of a horse at first sight; and in the refined employments of the stable can vie with the most expert groom or stable- boy. Concerning religion, unless he acquires it in the Racers' Kalendar or Taplin's Farriery, he has no opportunity of knowing anything about it. But in other parts of education, he is not deficient: he excels in those tropes or figures of speech which the vulgar call swearing; and his method of arguing is much more simple and convincing than the analytic or synthetic modes of the schools. By this mode (betting) he could argue with a philosopher, and come off victorious unless the philosopher were richer than he. As for the fair sex, the elegant society of the stable is preferable, in his estimation, to that of the drawing room; and the lounge among brother fine fellow in the coffeehouse, or tavern, is superior to the company of the ladies, in whose conversation his accomplishments do not enable him to bear a part. He pays his debts of honor much in the same manner as the fine fellow of 1733, can drink three bottles of wine, can kick the waiter, and knock down watchmen with good grace. In short, the fine fellow of the present day is neither calculated to add much to virtue by his good qualities nor to increase vice by his bad ones. (267)

In 1803, women became more accomplished and culturally ambitious than ever, even though they remained confined to the domestic sphere and still had to attend to domestic chores.

> Though the young ladies are seldom to be seen at the market, or, perhaps, do not interest themselves much in the management of household affairs; we may pronounce them superior to those of 1763, or 1783. Music, dancing, and grammatical knowledge of their own, and the French and Italian languages, are essential parts of modern female education; and though the making of pastry, jellies, and gooseberry wine, are not held of so much importance as they appear to have been in the first of these periods, yet they are not even now neglected.
> As domestic conveniences, the ladies of 1805 may be inferior to those of 1763; but as accomplished companions, they are certainly far from their superiors. (267)

On the whole, men and women improved in terms of their agreeableness, social manners, mental faculties for women, and athletic abilities for men.

> The gentleman of 1763 seems to have been so much under the restraint of rules, which regulated all his periods of amusement, as to leave him the very little exercise of thought or allow him little liberty of consulting his ease. In 1783 this stiffness was thrown off, ease and familiarity occupied its place, but vice and folly seem to have predominated. In 1805 this ease and freedom of manner continues; but, to the honor of the times, vice is not so prevalent as it is related to have been in 1783. The ladies have also much changed since 1763, but that change has been for the better. At that period they were good housewives and nurses, and, perhaps, nothing else; but in 1783 and 1785, if they have lost something of these qualities, they have made it sufficiently up by improving themselves in all that can 'be expected or wished in an interesting agreeable companion. (268)
