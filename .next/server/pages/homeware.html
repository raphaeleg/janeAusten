By the late Victorian era, their designs became more lavish, as they produced service plates, vases, and ornamental pieces which were adorned with gilding and jewelling (source). The Derby innovated and diversified themselves beyond their traditional styles, including raised gilding, piercing, and Perisian and Indian patterns (source). However, Derby’s tradition of fine painting flowers and landscapes continued. An example of this is their Campaña (or Campagna) vases, which were inspired by Greek kraters, were decorated with landscapes (source).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"fig-align-left\"\u003e\n  \u003cimg src=\"/images/RCD/marks.jpg\"\u003e\n  \u003cfigcaption\u003eRoyal Crown Derby Marks\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eRoyal Recognition\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing a prestigious tableware brand, the Derby was highly recognised in the royal community.

They first experimented with earlier salt-glazed styles and finishes instead of developing new stoneware like Wedgwood, giving stoneware “an entirely new impetus” (source). This was when artists were hired to produce vases, figures and religious plaques (source). One notable artist is Hannah Barlow, the second artist employed, who used the sgraffito technique to decorate the wares with animal studies (source).

Another one of Chamberlains' popular works was decorating porcelain in debased Japanese style (source).\nDuring the 1840s, the original Worcester company merged with Chamberlain's Factory to become Chamberlain \u0026#x26; Company.

This development was perfected by 1784 (source).\nThe popularity of blue-printed wares started with Chinese patterns and developed more into bamboo, willow and greek patterns in the 1800s (source).

However, before Spode I could perfect this recipe, he passed away in 1797 and Spode II had to continue his work (source).\nThe recipe Spode II perfected was a mixture of hard-paste porcelain and calcined bone, thus renaming the invention “Bone China”.
