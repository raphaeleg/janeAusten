<p>Beau Brummell was known as the arbiter elegantarium of Regency London—the “judge of propriety” in taste and manners (source). He used the principles of harmony of shape and contrast of colours with such pleasing results that men of superior rank sought his opinion on their own dress (source). Brummell is widely acknowledged as inventing the prototype of the modern men’s suit and inventing dandyism, solidifying the physical boundaries and reputation of London as the centre of gentlemanly style for centuries to come. Yet Brummell’s biographer Ian Kelly notes, “Brummell was renowned as a metropolitan wit before his personal style was copied by Londoners, Parisians and thence by urbane men the world over” (source).</p>
<h2>Dandyism</h2>
<p>Dandyism was not just a fashion statement, but rather an aesthetic that placed high importance on physical appearance and refined culture while maintaining an attitude of wit and nonchalance. In other words, an imitation of an aristocratic lifestyle. Ellen Moers comments that “The Brummell style … was suitable for all classes and occupations. Hardly altered in essentials, it would clothe democracy” (source).</p>
<h2>Dandyism- Fashion</h2>
<p>The Beau’s manner of distinction lay in the perfection of cut which provided him, as Kelly writes, with “arrestingly body-formed clothing” (source). Through collaboration with his tailors, Brummell sculpted the basic woollen coat from something leaden and stiff into a carefully shaped and padded simulacrum of the lithe neo-classical male torso. The contrast of shiny black boots, skin-tight buff breeches, and the shapely navy coat was crowned at the neck by the whimsical burst of a white linen cravat. For jewellery, he possessed one plain ring and a watch chain of “Venetian ducat gold” in an unusual design of which he only ever showed two links (source). He also owned an enviable collection of accessories such as canes (some carved with caricatures of the heads of noted members of society) and snuffboxes, claiming to possess a different one for each day of the year (source).</p>
<p>Brummell remains most famous for his morning dress, which was a combination of country sportswear and military details borrowed from his time as an officer of the 10th Hussars in Brighton (source). Jesse writes that his dress “was similar to that of every other gentleman—Hessians and pantaloons, or topboots and buckskins, with a blue coat, and a light or buff-coloured waistcoat; of course fitting to admiration, on the best figure in England” (source).
Dandyism- Attitude
Brumell placed high importance and standards on appearance. He claims that it takes him five hours a day to dress and recommends boots be polished with champagne (source). He was once asked how much it would cost to keep a man in clothes, he said “Why, with a tolerable economy, I think it might be done with £800” (source).</p>
<p>Brummell's influence went as far as shaping the lifestyle of aristocrats. For example, Brumell influenced the upper echelons of society to pay personal attention to their cleanliness through his own personal habits, such as cleaning his teeth, shaving, and daily bathing.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Brummell was educated at Eton and made his precocious mark on fashion when he not only modernised the white stock, or cravat, that was the mark of the Eton boy but added a gold buckle to it (source).
He progressed to Oxford University, where, by his own example, he made cotton stockings and dingy cravats a thing of the past. He left the university after only a year, at the age of sixteen for the military, where he met George IV, the Prince of Wales.
Brummell's friendship with, and influence over, the Prince of Wales continued after the military. He became the arbiter of fashion and established a mode of dress that rejected overly ornate clothes in favour of understated but perfectly fitted and tailored bespoke garments. This look was based on dark coats, full-length trousers rather than knee breeches and stockings, and above all, immaculate shirt linen and an elaborately knotted cravat (source)</p>
<h2>Downfall</h2>
<p>Brummell's wealthy friends influenced him; he began spending and gambling as though his fortune were as ample as theirs. He found it increasingly difficult to maintain his lifestyle, but his prominent position in society allowed him to float a line of credit.
in July 1813, at a masquerade ball jointly hosted at Watier's private club by Brummell, Lord Alvanley, Henry Mildmay and Henry Pierrepont. The four were considered the prime movers of Watier's, dubbed "the Dandy Club" by Byron. The Prince Regent greeted Alvanley and Pierrepont at the event, and then "cut" Brummell and Mildmay by staring at their faces without speaking (source). This provoked Brummell's remark, "Alvanley, who's your fat friend?".</p>
<p>The incident marked the final breach in a rift between Brummell and the Prince that had opened in 1811 when the Prince became Regent and began abandoning all his old Whig friends (source). Brummell became an anomalous favourite flourishing without a patron, influencing fashion and courted by a large segment of society (source).</p>
<p>In 1816, Brummell, owing thousands of pounds, fled to France to escape the debtor's prison. Usually, Brummell's gambling obligations, being "debts of honour", were paid immediately. The one exception to that was his final wager, dated March 1815 in White's betting book, which was marked "not paid, 20th January 1816" (source).</p>
<p>He lived the remainder of his life in French exile, spending ten years in Calais without an official passport. Rapidly running out of money and growing increasingly slovenly in his dress, his long-unpaid Calais creditors forced him into debtors' prison in 1835. Only through the charitable intervention of his friends in England was he able to secure his release later that year. In 1840, Brummell died at the age of 61, penniless and insane from syphilis, at Le Bon Sauveur Asylum on the outskirts of Caen. He is buried at Cimetière Protestant, Caen, France (source).</p></div><div></div></div></div></main></div><div class="background"></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"allPostsData":[{"id":"beau-brummell","title":"Beau Brummell","image":"/images/beauBrummell.jpg","imagecap":"Caricature of Beau Brummell done as a print by Robert Dighton, 1805.","lifespan":"1778-1840"},{"id":"emma-hamilton","title":"Emma Hamilton","image":"/images/emmaHamilton.jpg","imagecap":"\tGeorge Romney 1734–1802 Emma Hart as Circe c.1782 Tate Archive, Photo © Tate C-BY-NC-ND 3.0 (Unported)","lifespan":"1765-1815"},{"id":"lord-byron","title":"Lord Byron","image":"/images/byron.jpg","imagecap":"Portrait of Byron by Thomas Philips, c.1813","lifespan":"1786-1824"},{"id":"mrs-q","title":"Mrs. Q","image":"/images/mrsqThumbnail.png","imagecap":"Portrait of xxx","lifespan":"xxxx-1853"}],"postContent":[{"id":"beau-brummell","contentHtml":"\u003c!-- @format --\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeau Brummell was known as the arbiter elegantarium of Regency London—the “judge of propriety” in taste and manners (source).

Her attractive looks captured the attention of many rich aristocrats, becoming the mistress of a notable few, including Lord Nelson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith slightly pouted cherry-red lips, flowing chestnut hair, blue eyes and flushed cheeks, Emma was “a spectacle performing to a crowd” (source). She represented what society women wanted to be, changing the trends of fashion from stiff corsets and petticoats, to sexy flowing dresses with high waists (source). Additionally, her life was often depicted as dazzling and glamorous, often gossiped and shared about in newspapers (source). Yet it was her achievements and natural beauty that led to her downfall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eHumble Origins\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBorn in 1765 as Amy Lyon (source), Emma was quick to start working as an “under-nursemaid”, a domestic worker who cares for children within a large household, at age 12 (source). She was also quick to realise the greatest advantage that would help her survive in the world of aristocratic privilege and powerful men: her physical attractiveness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eRising to Fame\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt age 15, Emma was soon hired by Sir Harry Fetherstonhaugh, an English aristocrat for several months as a hostess and entertainer, were what she called her ‘giddy ways’ attracted other aristocrats (source). Her work included seductively dancing naked on the dining tables (source). By age 17, she had already borne a child by one of the guests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe then became a mistress to Charles Francis Greville on the condition that she change her name to Emma Hart and foster out her child (source). Through him, she caught the attention of George Romney and was soon his muse. She would pose as Greek figures such as the Goddess of Venus, producing some of Romney’s greatest works, which made her a celebrity (source).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreville soon grew tired of Emma and sent her to his uncle Sir William Hamilton, the British ambassador to the Kingdom of Naples in Italy. She was unknowingly abandoned under the pretence that Hamilton would “look after her for a while”. Hamilton found Emma very attractive (source).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce Emma found out about the exchange, she was furious but eventually accepted her new wealthy life with Hamilton. She married him at age 26, becoming Emma Hamilton, and rose to high Neapolitan society, where she grew quite close to Queen Maria Carolina of Naples and Sicily (source). At this point, Emma spent lavishly on balls, dinners and parties, where she would dance, sing and celebrate the passing of any English aristocrat (source).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith Hamilton’s encouragement, she started performing the “Attitudes”, also known as mimo-plastic arts, where she would dress in shawls and with her experience with Romney, combine classical poses with modern allure, acting as notable Greek figures (source). Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, theatre director and critic, wrote “The performance is like nothing you have ever seen before. With a few scarves and shawls she expressed a variety of wonderful transformations. One pose after another without a break” (source).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eLove Affair\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo years after she married Sir William, she had met Lord Horatio Nelson, a hero who led Britain’s victory over the French navy. They were madly in love despite both being married, as Emma wrote \"I must sin on and love him more than ever, It is a crime worth going to Hell for.\" (source). In 1801 at age 36, Emma bore a child by Nelson, named Horatia.

In his twenties, his feature was “of so exquisite a delicacy, that one might almost have given him a feminine appearance, but for the manly expression of his fine blue eyes.” His curly auburn hair also added to his good look. Lady Holland was left to say: “Was it possible not to love so lovable a creature? I see him there now, surrounded as it were by that great light: oh, how handsome he was!” Sir Walter Scott was mesmerized by Byron: “I never thought that any man except Byron could give an artist the exact idea of a poet. His portraits do not do him the least justice….The beauty of Byron” is “one which makes one dream.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cem\u003e“anti-fashion fashion icon.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eByron is considered by some to be an “anti-fashion fashion icon.” Beau Brummell stiffened his neckclothes, but Byron wore “unstarched and undone shirts” to set a “standard for casual masculinity that in its disheveled style served as a prototype for later Bohemians.” 1 Stendhal once met Byron in Milan in 1816, and gave this comment: “I shall never forget” the “divine expression of his look; it was the serene look of genius and power.” 2 However, in a letter dated December 10, 1822 to John Murray, Lord Byron declared that he had lived in “three or four” different worlds during his thirty-four years on earth. 3\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorge Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron, (1788-1824) was a British Romantic poet, reviewer, and satirist. The son of the handsome Captain John Byron and his second wife Catherine Gordon, a Scottish heiress, Byron was noted for his lameness due to his birth defect, a clubfoot. He was poor before the age of 10, but he inherited the title and fortune of his great-uncle William, the 5 th Baron Byron in 1798. As a result, Byron was sent to Harrow (1801-1805) and met the sensuous Lord Grey de Ruthyn. Regardless of what happened, Byron told his half-sister Augusta Byron many years later: “I am not reconciled to Lord Grey, and I never will” (BLJ 1:46). 4 In 1803 he fell in love with but was rejected by his already engaged cousin, Mary Chaworth. He left for Cambridge in 1805 and developed homophiliac attachments to John Edelston and Robert Rushton. In 1809 Byron took his seat in the House of Lords.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eByron’s Grand Tour (1809-1811)\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eByron’s Grand Tour (1809-1811) with his lifelong friend, John Cam Hobhouse, led him to Portugal, Spain, Malta, Greece, Albania, and Turkey. In Greece he swam the Hellespont to mimic Leander. 5 Byron was drawn to Spanish, Maltese, Greek women, but he found the grandsons of Ali Pasha particularly fascinating: “They are totally unlike our lads, have painted complexions like rouged dowagers, large black eyes\" features perfectly regular. They are the prettiest little animals I ever saw”(BLJ 1:231). Child Harold’s Pilgrimage was published in 1812 and greatly enhanced the poet’s popularity. Byron’s famous response was this: “I awoke one morning and found myself famous.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003ePolysexuality\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eByron had multiple affairs in England. He loved Caroline Lamb, the wife of William Lamb—the second son of Lord Melbourne. The eccentric Caroline was wont to cross-dress as a page or a young boy during some of their assignations. After a failed elopement, Byron had an affair with Lady Oxford, followed by romantic entanglements with his half-sister Augusta, the wife of Colonel George Leigh. In the meantime he also flirted with Lady Frances Webster, and always welcomed emotional triangulations to avoid deep commitment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1815 he decided to settle down and marry the high-minded Annabella Milbanke, the niece of Lady Melbourne. Lady Byron gave birth to a daughter, Augusta Ada Byron, but soon moved to live with her parents in 1816 amid rumors of Byron’s incestuous love of his half-sister as well as his polysexuality. The marriage ended in a legal separation in the same year. Byron immediately went on an exile, and never returned to England. Byron stayed with the Shelleys in Switzerland, and quickly began an affair with Mary Godwin’s half sister Claire Clairmont, who later gave birth to Allegra in 1817. The mother gave Allegra to the father, and Byron left her to be raised in a convent, where Allegra died at the age of five in 1822, having never been visited by her father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Italy, Byron loved his landlord’s wife Marianna Segati but always preferred polyamorous pursuits. He informed a friend Douglas Kinnaird that he had “a dozen” new loves (BLJ 6:42), and to another friend, James Wedderburn Webster that he had fun with “around two hundred” Venetian women (BLJ 6:65-6). In 1819, he reported his conquest: “some of them” were “Countesses,” some of them were “wives,” “some noble—some middling—some low--\" all whores” (BLJ 6:92). His Italian adventures inspired Don Juan—an unfinished epic poem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eByron’s Decline\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eByron looked old and fat in 1818 but this soon changed because of the 19 year old Countess Teresa Gamba Guiccioli, the wife of an elderly but powerful diplomat Conte Alessandro Guiccioli. Byron was also known for being her gentleman –in-waiting. In a letter dated 1819, Byron made this claim: “You sometimes tell me I have been your first real love—and I assure that you shall be my last Passion. I may well hope not to fall in love again, now that everything has become indifferent to me. Before I knew you—I felt an interest in many women, but never in one only.
