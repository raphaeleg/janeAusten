Although the company received initial success as a principal tableware company in the 18th century, it suffered with constant business takeovers (source). Nevertheless the Derby traditions of fine craftsmanship was maintained, where no two pieces were the same. In the 18th century, many of the painters hired in the company specialised in landscapes and seascapes, still lifes, pastorals, birds, and intricate floral patterns.</p>\n<figure class=\"fig-align-right\">\n  <img src=\"/images/RCD/ImariC.jpg\">\n  <figcaption>Imari Pattern wares</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2>Aesthetics</h2>\n<p>Royal Crown Derby was always in demand, as their product’s designs always met the popular aesthetic of the period. Around the early 19th century, their products adopted lavish Japanese Imari patterns that were bolder, with brighter colors, larger shapes, and geometric patterns (source). By the late Victorian era, their designs became more lavish, as they produced service plates, vases, and ornamental pieces which were adorned with gilding and jewelling (source). The Derby innovated and diversified themselves beyond their traditional styles, including raised gilding, piercing, and Perisian and Indian patterns (source). However, Derby’s tradition of fine painting flowers and landscapes continued. An example of this is their Campaña (or Campagna) vases, which were inspired by Greek kraters, were decorated with landscapes (source).</p>\n<figure class=\"fig-align-left\">\n  <img src=\"/images/RCD/marks.jpg\">\n  <figcaption>Royal Crown Derby Marks</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2>Royal Recognition</h2>\n<p>Being a prestigious tableware brand, the Derby was highly recognised in the royal community.

When it first started, the business was still finding its speciality, especially as a latecomer to the ceramics industry.</p>\n<h2>Utility Products</h2>\n<p>Their first products were salt-glazed stoneware focused on more utility, as the trade created ceramics, jars, bottles, and flasks, mainly intended for inns and pubs (source). Around the 1840s, during the cholera pandemic, the product line expanded to include more sanitary fittings and drainpipes to improve living conditions, which was quite successful (source).</p>\n<h2>Decorative Art Pottery</h2>\n<p>During the 1860s, aesthetics held a greater role in the production line, as Doulton &#x26; Watts. became one of the first to make decorative art pottery using stoneware. They first experimented with earlier salt-glazed styles and finishes instead of developing new stoneware like Wedgwood, giving stoneware “an entirely new impetus” (source). This was when artists were hired to produce vases, figures and religious plaques (source). One notable artist is Hannah Barlow, the second artist employed, who used the sgraffito technique to decorate the wares with animal studies (source). By the 1890s, more than 300 artists were employed under Doulton &#x26; Watts (source).</p>\n<h2>Bone China</h2>\n<p>Around the 1880s, Doulton &#x26; Co. started to produce bone china as a means of diversifying their materials.

It was established by chemist Dr. John Wall, apothecary William Davis, and their prior experiments in making a porcelain-like substance (source) using soaprock (source). Their production was held in such secrecy that anyone who disclosed the workings had to pay £4000 (source).</p>\n<h2>Craftsmanship specialty</h2>\n<p>They continued experimenting by attempting to replicate the blue and white Nankin patterns of a simple character (source). Around 1755, there was a breakthrough, as Worcester was producing blue and white porcelain teawares, which was sturdy enough to hold boiling water, and affordable for the middle class (source). For the rest of the 18th century, Worcester continued to improve it’s a craft, through transfer printing and engravings, and imitating popular aesthetics such as Rococo and Oriental, Meissen, Underglaze blue backgrounds, Japanese Imari, and more (source).</p>\n<h2>Financial Decline</h2>\n<p>In 1776, Dr Walls passed away, which initiated the coming extinction of Worcester productions (source). Despite this, it received a royal warrant from George III as \"Royal Porcelain Works\". Meanwhile, Robert Chamberlain, the first apprentice in Worcester, started his own business Chamberlain's Factory in continuing the Worcester traditions, which was quite successful, even receiving its own royal warrant from the Rince Regent in 1811 (source).\nOne of Chamberlains' popular works was his decorative pieces of country houses and figure subjects from famous paintings or plays, such as scenes from Shakespeare's plays (source). Another one of Chamberlains' popular works was decorating porcelain in debased Japanese style (source).\nDuring the 1840s, the original Worcester company merged with Chamberlain's Factory to become Chamberlain &#x26; Company. Their productions were focused on buttons, porcelain door furniture, and medieval encaustic floor tiles for renovated churches (source).</p>\n<h2>Blush Ivory Porcelain</h2>\n<p>Inspired by the Art Nouveau style in the 1890s, Royal Worcester developed porcelain with organic forms, such as shell dishes and baskets, and natural materials, such as coral-handled jugs (source). This was extremely popular, to the extent of imitations being sold, pressuring Royal Worcester out of the market (source).\nhttps://www.bidsquare.com/online-auctions/broward/19c-royal-worcester-ewer-pitcher-jug-1050502</p>","title":"Royal Worcester","image":"/images/RW/logo.png","imagecap":"","lifespan":""},{"id":"spode","contentHtml":"<!-- @format -->\n<p>Founded in 1770 by Josiah Spode I, the company produced earthware and stonewares and invented two fundamental pottery techniques; Blue transfer printing on underglaze earthwares that sparked the Spode’s Blue Italian range, and the standardized formula for bone china (source).</p>\n<p>Spode’s first products consisted of large vases, that were heavily decorated and gilded in a neoclassical art style. In the early 19th century, Spode II was one of the leading factories that produced Japanese Imari patterns, when he received the title “Potter to the Prince of Wales” from the Prince Regent (source).</p>\n<h2>Underglaze blue transfer printing</h2>\n<p>Underglaze refers to the process of applying a design on the surface before applying glaze for protection (source).\nThe process Spode developed used gummed tissues to transfer the designs from an engraved copper plate to the earthenware surface. Then by using Spode’s developed glaze recipe, a deep cobalt colour print was maintained (source). This development was perfected by 1784 (source).\nThe popularity of blue-printed wares started with Chinese patterns and developed more into bamboo, willow and greek patterns in the 1800s (source). By the 1810s engraved sporting scenes in an Italian setting also became quite popular (source).</p>\n<h2>The bone china formula</h2>\n<p>By the 1740s, many English potters were competing for the recipe to make ceramics similar to those from China with alternative ingredients that were more geographically accessible (source). In 1796, Spode I invented the hybrid porcelain “Stoke China” by combining hard-paste porcelain (china clay mixed with china stone), and bone ash (source). However, before Spode I could perfect this recipe, he passed away in 1797 and Spode II had to continue his work (source).\nThe recipe Spode II perfected was a mixture of hard-paste porcelain and calcined bone, thus renaming the invention “Bone China”.
