Austen uses words such as “beautiful,” “handsome,” “pretty,” and “smart” to rank different degrees of attractiveness. Mr Knightley says that Emma is “pretty,” but Mrs Weston disagrees: “Pretty! Say beautiful rather.Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than Emma ?” _( E 39 )_.<sup>1</sup> Near the end of _Pride and Prejudice_, Darcy judges that Elizabeth is “one of the handsomest women” in his eyes. This order of beauty is likewise implied in Dr Johnson’s _Dictionary_.

“Beauty” is “that assemblage of graces, or proportion of parts, which pleases the eye.”

“Handsome” is understood to mean “beautiful with dignity” or “elegant” and “graceful.”

“Prettiness” is “beauty without majesty; neat elegance without elevation.” 

“Smart” describes someone who is “witty,” “vivacious,” and “lively.”<sup>2</sup>

Austen may or may not know of or agree with Johnson’s definitions, but she certainly understands the differences between these terms. “Beautiful” denotes the possession of good physical and cultural capital, and these attributes seldom materialize without financial capital. “Handsome” emphasizes a person’s display of good looks, financial or social status, and cultural capital.Women can behave elegantly or gracefully, but dignity may not suit those at the bottom of the pecking order. “Pretty” infers good physical and cultural traits, while “smart” emphasizes the possession of a lovely face and vivacious personality.

Austen’s perfect beauty is a woman who combines high status, good looks, agreeable manners, and elegant style. Lady Honeywood is perfect because she is gifted biologically, socially, and financially. The display of stylish dress and a carriage pulled by not two but four horses arouses admiration, and her ladyship pleases everyone thanks to her graceful manners, which reveal a high degree of agreeableness. In a letter dated 6 November 1813, Austen shares her thoughts with her sister Cassandra:
> Lady Honeywood, you know; —I  did not sit near enough to be a perfect Judge, but I thought her extremely pretty & her manners have all the recommendations of ease & good humour & unaffectedness; —& going about with 4 Horses, & nicely dressed herself—she is altogether a perfect sort of Woman( Letters 263 ).<sup>3</sup>

In Austen’s novelistic world, Emma Woodhouse is portrayed as a perfect beauty thanks to her good (physical, financial) health, good looks, good manners, and good social and cultural capital.She has brilliant “hazle eyes,” “regular features, open countenance,” and a nice complexion that displays “a bloom of full health.” She also has “a pretty height and size” and a “firm and upright figure” that shows her healthy superiority in “her air, her head, her glance...... She is loveliness itself” _( E 39 )_. Emma is cultured and affable. She socializes extensively, visiting rich and poor neighbors alike.

However, Austen also highlights a “style of beauty” that does not require a large fortune, high status, or beautiful dress. Jane Fairfax has a good face and figure, but her strongest asset is an “elegance” of “person or of mind” _( E 167 )_. Jane Fairfax has beauty, distinction, merit, accomplishments, and manners. Unfortunately, these are not endearing qualities because of the wide gap between her dignified elegance and her poor social and financial status. Mr Woodhouse’s opinion on Jane Fairfax reflects his normative judgment: Jane is a “very pretty sort of young lady, a very pretty and a very well - behaved young lady” _( E 171 )_.  However, Emma applies strict assessment criteria that emphasize physical features and cultural attributes.She is annoyed when she finds out that Jane scores high in every category. In fact, the poor orphan is an accomplished and superior pianist. 

> Jane Fairfax was very elegant, remarkably elegant; and [Emma] had herself the highest value for elegance. [Jane’s] height was pretty, just such as almost every body would think tall, and nobody could think very tall; her figure particularly graceful; her size a most becoming medium, between fat and thin, though a slight appearance of ill - health seemed to point out the likeliest evil of the two. Emma could not but feel all this; and then, her face—her features—there was more beauty in them altogether than she had remembered; it was not regular, but it was very pleasing beauty. Her eyes, a deep grey, with dark eye - lashes and eyebrows, had never been denied their praise; but the skin, which she had been used to cavil at, as wanting colour, had a clearness and delicacy which really needed no fuller bloom. It was a style of beauty, of which elegance was the reigning character, and as such, she must, in honour, by all her principles, admire it: —elegance, which, whether of person or of mind, she saw so little in Highbury _( E 167 )_.

In addition, Austen understands the distinction between handsome and pretty. According to Johnson’s definitions, “handsome” comes with status markers such as “dignity” or “majesty,” while prettiness indicates loveliness, elegance, and grace.A “handsome” woman is more than a pretty woman, and Austen’s letters suggest a similar take: 
> [Miss Bendish] is very young & rather handsome, & whose gracious manners, ready wit, & solid remarks put me somewhat in mind of my old acquaintance Lucy Lefroy( Letters 108 ).

Austen has no desire to set the bar too high or to link handsomeness to wealth. A handsome woman may or may not have deep pockets, but she can still enjoy high social or cultural status. 
> The young lady whom it is suspected that Sir Thomas is to marry, is Miss Emma Wabshaw; —she lives somewhere between Southampton and Winchester, is handsome, accomplished, amiable, & everything but rich ( Letters 64 ).

In addition, Austen— a best-selling author— is glad when people find her “handsome,” even though some deem her merely “prettyish.” She tells Cassandra that “Lady B. found me handsomer than she expected, so you see I am not so very bad as you might think for” _( Letters 262 )_. However, owing to her impoverished social status, Mrs Mary Russell Mitford acknowledges Austen’s physical assets but declares that the latter is simply “the prettiest, silliest, most affected, husband hunting butterfly she ever remembers.” After Austen’s rise to fame, Mrs Mitford complains that _Mansfield Park_ and _Pride and Prejudice_ still display Miss Austen’s “want of elegance” and “taste.” In 1815, a friend of the Mitfords eventually describes the unmarried but dignified Austen in this way:
> [Jane] has stiffened into the most perpendicular, precise, taciturn piece of “single blessedness” that ever existed, and that, till “Pride and Prejudice” showed what a gem was hidden in that unbending case, she was no more regarded in society than a poker or a fire - screen, or any other thin upright piece of wood or iron that fills its corner in peace and quietness.<sup>4</sup>

For her part, Austen frequently notes the discrepancies between those who possess good capital and good looks. The Heathcotes are a respectable Tory family, and one of the Heathcotes becomes an MP for Hampshire. Austen observes that “Miss Heathcote is pretty, but not near so handsome as I expected” _( Letters 1 )_.The two eventually become good friends. Women with notable accomplishments also catch Austen’s eyes because she is the musician in her family. 


> [Miss Harding] is an elegant, pleasing, pretty - looking girl, about nineteen, I suppose, or nineteen and a half, or nineteen and a quarter, with flowers in her head and music at her finger ends.She plays very well indeed. I have seldom heard anybody with more pleasure( Letters 197 ).

Austen’s letters reveal that she is used to making criteria - referenced judgments, and she can act like Miss Bingley or Mr Darcy in her wholesale rejection of party - goers at Deane. In 1800, she attends a ball of fifty people. Her complaint is that there “were only twelve dances, of which [she] danced nine, & was merely prevented from dancing the rest by the want of a partner.” When she discusses the ball with her sister, she notes that there “were very few Beauties” on the whole, and those who were deemed beauties “were not very handsome” _( Letters 63 )_.
> Miss Iremonger did not look well, & Mrs. Blount was the only one much admired. She appeared exactly as she did in September, with the same broad face, diamond bandeau, white shoes, pink husband, & fat neck. —The two Miss Coxes were there; I traced in one the remains of the vulgar, broad featured girl who danced at Enham eight years ago; —the other is refined into a nice, composed looking girl like Catherine Bigg.—I looked at Sir Thomas Champneys & thought of poor Rosalie; I looked at his daughter & thought her a queer animal with a white neck.—Mrs.Warren, I was constrained to think a very fine young woman, which I much regret.She has got rid of some part of her child, & danced away with great activity, looking by no means very large. —Her  husband is ugly enough; uglier even than his cousin John; but he does not look so very old. —The Miss Maitlands are both prettyish; very like Anne; with brown skins, large dark eyes, & a good deal of nose. —The General has got the Gout, and Mrs.Maitland the Jaundice. —Miss Debary, Susan & Sally all in black, but without any Statues, made their appearance, & I was as civil to them as their bad breath would allow me( Letters 63 ).

As Austen’s letters are meant for private eyes only, it is difficult to say whether these comments are meant to amuse her family or to be taken objectively. Her observations show that she pays close attention to facial features such as (dark) eyes, nose, skin, and neck. Particular emphasis is also given to civil manners and good health condition. People with bad breath, gout, or jaundice fail to impress her. 

Nevertheless, Austen’s assessment also reveals that other than face and figure, she shows a degree of weight, age, and moral bias. She is a supporter of “thin is beautiful.” This may have something to do with the fact that Jane herself is “quite tall and slender at approximately 5 feet 7 inches, with a 30 - 32 inch bust, making her a modern UK size 6 or US size 2.”<sup>5</sup> While men prefer young women, Austen favors ladies in their late twenties; hence she is acutely aware of the problem of age discrimination. People often slight ladies who are past their prime, but they have even more problems with mature ladies with perpetual good looks. In Persuasion, Elizabeth Elliot is handsome but not young:     
> It sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty - nine than she was ten years before; and, generally speaking, if there has been neither ill health nor anxiety, it is a time of life at which scarcely any charm is lost.It was so with Elizabeth, still the same handsome Miss Elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago ( P 6 ).

In reality, Austen knows that a middle - aged woman’s beauty can only invite neighbors’ resentment and envy and intensify the problem of ageism. In a letter, she notices that
> Miss Wapshire has been for many years a distinguished beauty. —She is now seven or eight & twenty, and tho’ still handsome less handsome than she has been. —This promises better, than the bloom of seventeen; & in addition to this, they say that she has always been remarkable for the propriety of her behavior, distinguishing her far above the general class of Town Misses, & rendering her of course very unpopular among them ( Letters 67 ).

Finally, Austen does not find adulterers attractive In Bath, she spots the adulteress at once. 
> I have a very good eye at an Adultress, for tho’ repeatedly assured that another in the same party was the She, I fixed upon the right one from the first. —A resemblance to Mrs.Leigh was my guide. She is not so pretty as I expected; her face has the same defect of baldness as her sister's, & her features not so handsome; —she was highly rouged, & looked rather quietly & contentedly silly than anything else. (Letters 88)

Austen differs from Mary Wollstonecraft in the sense that the latter links beauty to patriarchy and condemns the resulting emphasis on beauty. In _A Vindication of the Rights of Women_, Wollstonecraft observes that the “conduct and manners of women, in fact, show clearly that their minds are not in a healthy state” because “strength and usefulness are sacrificed to beauty.”<sup>6</sup> Female upbringing trains women to be “slaves” in a “political” and “civil” sense: “the girls’ limbs and faculties are cramped with worse - than - Chinese bands.” They live a “sedentary life” in the private sphere; they glory in making conquests in public; they manipulate and trick men with their “sick delicacy,” “false sentiments,” and “over-stretched feelings” to enjoy power by proxy. They are taught that the gateway to success is beauty and fashion: “Taught from their infancy that beauty is woman’s scepter, the mind shapes itself to the body, and roaming around in its gilt cage it only seeks to adorn its prison.”<sup>7</sup> Men further instill in women their own fear of the “unsexed” intellectual woman.
> [A] German writer has shrewdly observed that a pretty woman is an object of desire for men of all descriptions, whereas a fine woman, who inspires more sublime emotions by displaying intellectual beauty, may have no attraction for men who find their happiness in the gratification of their appetites.<sup>8</sup>

Austen does not see that beauty essentially reduces women to becoming ornamental objects, and she clearly criticizes men’s objectification of women as well as their preference for unintellectual women. She is aware that beauty’s privileges are real; beautiful people may have greater mobility, but they are also constantly being surveilled, discussed, criticized, or on rare occasions, bullied. Austen wants to see Sophia because she “is a disputable Beauty that I want much to see.” She notices that “Mrs. Portman is not much admired in Dorsetshire; the good - natured world, as usual, extolled her beauty so highly, that all the neighbourhood have had the pleasure of being disappointed” _( Letters 264, 20 )_.

Beauty demonstrates genetic, birth-related, social, and cultural inequalities. Austen is probably no lenient judge, but her critical eye makes her a successful novelist. When she looks at all the distinguished beauties, disputable beauties, and all the ladies, she rates them privately according to her idea of beauty, sense, and merit, and she knows how love and marriage can take place in spite of the lack of any one or all three attributes. As long as everything is safe in her world, her wit flows long.
