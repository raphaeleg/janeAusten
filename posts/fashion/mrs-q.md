Not much is known about Georgiana Quentin or her own pseudonym Harriet Quentin, Mrs Q.
She married Sir George Augustus Quentin, was reputedly unfaithful and became celebrated as a royal mistress to George IV when he was prince regent (source). In 1822 a pamphlet appeared, Memoirs of the Celebrated Mrs Q—– by "Edward Eglantine", a pseudonym of William Benbow (source). The pamphlet included a portrait of Mrs Q by the French portrait painter François Huet-Villiers.

## Inspiration for Austen

Austen reports seeing a painting of how she imagines Jane Bennet, who marries Mr Bingley at the conclusion of Pride and Prejudice. "Mrs Bingley is exactly herself, size, shaped face, features & sweetness; there never was a greater likeness. She is dressed in a white gown, with green ornaments, which convinces me of what I had always supposed, that green was a favourite colour with her." Scholars suspect that the painting she refers to is the Portrait of Mrs Q (source).
