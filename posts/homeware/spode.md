Founded in 1770 by Josiah Spode I, the company produced earthware and stonewares and invented two fundamental pottery techniques; Blue transfer printing on underglaze earthwares that sparked the Spode’s Blue Italian range, and the standardized formula for bone china (source).

Spode’s first products consisted of large vases, that were heavily decorated and gilded in a neoclassical art style. In the early 19th century, Spode II was one of the leading factories that produced Japanese Imari patterns, when he received the title “Potter to the Prince of Wales” from the Prince Regent (source). 

## Underglaze blue transfer printing
Underglaze refers to the process of applying a design on the surface before applying glaze for protection (source). 
The process Spode developed used gummed tissues to transfer the designs from an engraved copper plate to the earthenware surface. Then by using Spode’s developed glaze recipe, a deep cobalt colour print was maintained (source). This development was perfected by 1784 (source).
The popularity of blue-printed wares started with Chinese patterns and developed more into bamboo, willow and greek patterns in the 1800s (source). By the 1810s engraved sporting scenes in an Italian setting also became quite popular (source).

## The bone china formula
By the 1740s, many English potters were competing for the recipe to make ceramics similar to those from China with alternative ingredients that were more geographically accessible (source). In 1796, Spode I invented the hybrid porcelain “Stoke China” by combining hard-paste porcelain (china clay mixed with china stone), and bone ash (source). However, before Spode I could perfect this recipe, he passed away in 1797 and Spode II had to continue his work (source). 
The recipe Spode II perfected was a mixture of hard-paste porcelain and calcined bone, thus renaming the invention “Bone China”. The addition of bone ash gave the ware surface a warm tint (source).
