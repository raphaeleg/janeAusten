A ceramic and home accessory manufacturer founded in 1815, Royal Doulton was originally known by the names of its three founders, Jones, Watts, and Doulton. Henry Doulton later adopted the name. Being a late entry into the ceramics industry, the company was still developing its area of expertise when it first got off the ground.

## Utility Products

As the trade produced ceramics, jars, bottles, and flasks, mostly for inns and pubs, their first products were salt-glazed stoneware that was more utility in nature. <sup>1</sup> During the cholera pandemic in the 1840s, the product line was expanded to include more sanitary fixtures and drainpipes in an effort to improve living conditions. <sup>2</sup>

## Decorative Art Pottery

During the 1860s, aesthetics held a greater role in the production line, as Doulton & Watts. became one of the first to make decorative art pottery using stoneware. In order to give stoneware "an entirely new impetus," they first experimented with earlier salt-glazed styles and finishes as opposed to creating new ones like Wedgwood. <sup>3</sup> At that time, artisans were employed to create vases, statues, and religious plaques. <sup>2</sup> Hannah Barlow, the second artist hired, is one notable artist who used the sgraffito technique to decorate the goods with animal studies. <sup>2</sup> More than 300 artists were working for Doulton & Watts by the 1890s. <sup>2</sup>

## Bone China

Doulton & Co. began making bone china in the 1880s as a way to diversify their product line. Bone china's artistic direction developed from hand-painted ornamentals to sculptural pieces that attracted the attention of the global market. By 1901, King Edward VII granted the business a royal warrant, transforming it into Royal Doulton. <sup>1</sup>
