Royal Doulton, initially named after the three founders Jones, Watts & Doulton, and later taken by Henry Doulton, is a ceramic and home accessories manufacturer established in 1815. When it first started, the business was still finding its speciality, especially as a latecomer to the ceramics industry. 
## Utility Products
Their first products were salt-glazed stoneware focused on more utility, as the trade created ceramics, jars, bottles, and flasks, mainly intended for inns and pubs (source). Around the 1840s, during the cholera pandemic, the product line expanded to include more sanitary fittings and drainpipes to improve living conditions, which was quite successful (source).
 
## Decorative Art Pottery
During the 1860s, aesthetics held a greater role in the production line, as Doulton & Watts. became one of the first to make decorative art pottery using stoneware. They first experimented with earlier salt-glazed styles and finishes instead of developing new stoneware like Wedgwood, giving stoneware “an entirely new impetus” (source). This was when artists were hired to produce vases, figures and religious plaques (source). One notable artist is Hannah Barlow, the second artist employed, who used the sgraffito technique to decorate the wares with animal studies (source). By the 1890s, more than 300 artists were employed under Doulton & Watts (source).
 
## Bone China
Around the 1880s, Doulton & Co. started to produce bone china as a means of diversifying their materials. The art direction on bone china started with hand-painted ornamentals and evolved into sculptural pieces, which caught the attention of the international market. By 1901, the company received a royal warrant from King Edward VII, becoming Royal Doulton (source).
