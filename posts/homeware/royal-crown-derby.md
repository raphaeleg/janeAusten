Established in 1750, Royal Crown Derby is one of the oldest remaining English porcelain manufacturers famous for its prestigious tableware. Although the company received initial success as a principal tableware company in the 18th century, it suffered with constant business takeovers (source). Nevertheless the Derby traditions of fine craftsmanship was maintained, where no two pieces were the same. In the 18th century, many of the painters hired in the company specialised in landscapes and seascapes, still lifes, pastorals, birds, and intricate floral patterns.

## Aesthetics


Royal Crown Derby was always in demand, as their product’s designs always met the popular aesthetic of the period. Around the early 19th century, their products adopted lavish Japanese Imari patterns that were bolder, with brighter colors, larger shapes, and geometric patterns (source). By the late Victorian era, their designs became more lavish, as they produced service plates, vases, and ornamental pieces which were adorned with gilding and jewelling (source). The Derby innovated and diversified themselves beyond their traditional styles, including raised gilding, piercing, and Perisian and Indian patterns (source). However, Derby’s tradition of fine painting flowers and landscapes continued. An example of this is their Campaña (or Campagna) vases, which were inspired by Greek kraters, were decorated with landscapes (source).

## Royal Recognition

Being a prestigious tableware brand, the Derby was highly recognised in the royal community. In 1773 King George III permitted the Derby to incorporate the royal crown into their backstamp, and by 1890, the Derby received the royal warrant, becoming the "Manufacturers of porcelain to Her Majesty" and "The Royal Crown Derby Porcelain Company" (source).
