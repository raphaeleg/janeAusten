The Ginori 1735 is a porcelain company that is a representative of the Florentine identity (source). It was built by Marquis Carlo Andrea Ginori in Doccia with beauty as its major value, as he was inspired by the white gold palette (source). During the 18th century, Gnori started its production of porcelain with gold-gilt tableware (source). Gori was also an important player in expanding international relations with other countries, sharing its Florentine identity with the world (source).

By 1806, the company was taken over by Leopoldo Carlo Ginori Liscie continued to bring diverse directions to Gnori’s products (source). Many of their works became more elegant, featuring more coloured and detailed paintings and sculptures, often presenting the setting of a story within. Many of these were classically inspired by Greek stories (source).
