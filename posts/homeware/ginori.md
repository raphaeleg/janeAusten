Porcelain manufacturer The Ginori 1735 serves as a symbol of Florentine culture. <sup>1</sup> Marquis Carlo Andrea Ginori, who was motivated by the white gold color scheme, constructed it in Doccia with beauty as its primary value. <sup>2</sup> Ginori began manufacturing porcelain in the 18th century along with gold-gilded tableware. <sup>2</sup> Sharing its Florentine identity with the world, Ginori played a significant role in fostering international ties with other nations. <sup>1</sup>

Leopoldo Carlo Ginori Liscie took over the business in 1806, and he continued to give Gnori's products a variety of directions. <sup>2</sup> Many of their creations evolved into more elegant pieces with vividly colored, intricate paintings and sculptures that frequently depicted the scene of a story. Greek myths served as the classical inspiration for many of these. <sup>3</sup>

Ginori's ability to maintain such high technical standards has allowed them to satisfy their clients' desired style. <sup>4</sup>
