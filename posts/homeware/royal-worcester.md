Royal Worcester was established in Worcester at 1751, and being one of the oldest remaining English porcelain manufacturer. It was established by chemist Dr. John Wall, apothecary William Davis, and their prior experiments in making a porcelain-like substance (source) using soaprock (source). Their production was held in such secrecy that anyone who disclosed the workings had to pay £4000 (source).
## Craftsmanship specialty
They continued experimenting by attempting to replicate the blue and white Nankin patterns of a simple character (source). Around 1755, there was a breakthrough, as Worcester was producing blue and white porcelain teawares, which was sturdy enough to hold boiling water, and affordable for the middle class (source). For the rest of the 18th century, Worcester continued to improve it’s a craft, through transfer printing and engravings, and imitating popular aesthetics such as Rococo and Oriental, Meissen, Underglaze blue backgrounds, Japanese Imari, and more (source).

## Financial Decline
In 1776, Dr Walls passed away, which initiated the coming extinction of Worcester productions (source). Despite this, it received a royal warrant from George III as "Royal Porcelain Works". Meanwhile, Robert Chamberlain, the first apprentice in Worcester, started his own business Chamberlain's Factory in continuing the Worcester traditions, which was quite successful, even receiving its own royal warrant from the Rince Regent in 1811 (source). 
One of Chamberlains' popular works was his decorative pieces of country houses and figure subjects from famous paintings or plays, such as scenes from Shakespeare's plays (source). Another one of Chamberlains' popular works was decorating porcelain in debased Japanese style (source). 
During the 1840s, the original Worcester company merged with Chamberlain's Factory to become Chamberlain & Company. Their productions were focused on buttons, porcelain door furniture, and medieval encaustic floor tiles for renovated churches (source). 
  
## Blush Ivory Porcelain
Inspired by the Art Nouveau style in the 1890s, Royal Worcester developed porcelain with organic forms, such as shell dishes and baskets, and natural materials, such as coral-handled jugs (source). This was extremely popular, to the extent of imitations being sold, pressuring Royal Worcester out of the market (source).
