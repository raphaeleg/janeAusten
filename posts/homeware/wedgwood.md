“Timeless Eclecticism since 1759” Wedgwood heavily embraces the values of the founder Josiah Wedgwood I, who started as a regular 29-year-old, and is remembered as the “Father of English Potters”, leading the industrialisation of the manufacture of European pottery (source).
Compared to other pottery companies at the time, Wedgwood experimented more on the aesthetic potential of clay, becoming a trendsetter brand. As a result, Wedgwood became the founding place for Jasper, Queen's Ware and Black Basalt (source).

## Jasperware

After thousands of experiments, Jasperware was invented in 1774 and stands as Wedgwood’s most famous works. It was a type of unglazed stoneware with a matte finish that is mainly used for decoration and sculptures instead of tableware (source). Jasperware finishes in a variety of colours, but the iconic Wedgwood blue is the most recognisable as Wedgwood’s signature (source).

## Queen’s Ware

The first royal member Wedgwood’s works appealed to was Queen Charlotte. Her first purchase was a set of cream-colored earthenware. Impressed by its qualities and style, Josiah Wedgwood was referred to as “Potter to Her Majesty”, and his creamware as “Queen's Ware” (source). Since then, Wedgwood products have proudly resided in the British royal households, receiving the Royal Warrant in 1995 (source).

## Black Basalt

“The Black is sterling, & will last for ever.” Appearing in 1768, Black Basalt was a fine-grained stoneware that achieved its colours through the additions of manganese and carr sourced from coal mines (source). Although the material was used for domestic objects, Wedgwood took a more artisan approach and created at least 100 beautiful decorative sculptures of important figures (source).
