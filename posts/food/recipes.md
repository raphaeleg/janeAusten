- Flour, as needed

## Salmon, Herrings, Sprats, Mackerel, &c. Pickled

_(Kitchiner, 235-236)_

Ingredients:

- Salmon, Herrings, Sprats, Mackerel, or any fish of your choice
- Water
- Salt
- Vinegar
- Fresh fennel sprigs

Instructions:

1. Cut the fish into proper pieces, leaving the scales on, and place them in a pot.
2. Make a brine strong enough to bear an egg, by boiling water with salt. Add enough brine to the pot to cover the fish.
3. Boil the fish in the brine for only as long as it takes for it to cook, making sure to not overcook it. Once cooked, remove the fish from the pot and allow it to drain off any remaining liquid.
4. When the fish has cooled, pack it tightly in a kit or jar.
5. Mix equal parts of the liquid the salmon was boiled in (skimmed first) and vinegar, and pour it into the kit, making sure the fish is completely covered.
6. Let the fish sit for a day, and then fill up the kit again and seal it tightly with a cooper's adze.
7. Store the kit in a cool, dry place.

Note:

- Pickled salmon is best when fresh, and is most plentiful from February to September.
- Freshly gathered young fennel sprigs are recommended as accompaniments to the pickled fish.
- The three indispensable marks of the goodness of pickled salmon are the brightness of the scales sticking fast to the skin, the firmness of the flesh, and a delicate pale red rose color.

- Butter or beef dripping
- Salt and pepper, to taste

Instructions:

1. Take equal quantities of cold-boiled beef, cabbage, and potatoes.
2. Chop the beef, cabbage, and potatoes coarsely.
3. Heat a frying pan with some butter or beef dripping.
4. Add the chopped beef, cabbage, and potatoes to the pan.
5. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
6. Fry the mixture over medium heat, turning it occasionally, until it is well-browned and crispy.

## Soup-Herb Powder or Vegetable Relish

_(Kitchiner, 377-378)_

Ingredients:

- 2 oz dried parsley
- 2 oz dried winter savory
- 2 oz dried sweet marjoram
- 2 oz dried lemon-thyme
- 1 oz dried lemon peel
- 1 oz dried sweet basil
- Optional: 1 drachm dried bay leaves and 1 drachm celery seed

Instructions:

1. Dry the herbs in a warm, but not too hot Dutch oven.
2. Once fully dried, pound the herbs in a mortar and pass them through a double hair sieve.
3. Bottle the herb powder, ensuring that it is closely stopped.

Note:

- The powder will retain its fragrance and flavor for several months.
- These herbs are in full perfection in July and August. An infusion of the above in vinegar or wine makes a good relishing sauce, but the flavor is best when made with freshly gathered herbs
- This composition of fine aromatic herbs is an invaluable acquisition to the cook in those seasons or situations when fresh herbs cannot be had. It impregnates sauce, soup, etc. with as much relish and renders it agreeable to the palate and refreshes the gustatory nerves without so much risk of offending the stomach, etc.
