Byron was known today for his uncommon beauty and his polysexuality. In his twenties, his feature was “of so exquisite a delicacy, that one might almost have given him a feminine appearance, but for the manly expression of his fine blue eyes.” His curly auburn hair also added to his good look. Lady Holland was left to say: “Was it possible not to love so lovable a creature? I see him there now, surrounded as it were by that great light: oh, how handsome he was!” Sir Walter Scott was mesmerized by Byron: “I never thought that any man except Byron could give an artist the exact idea of a poet. His portraits do not do him the least justice….The beauty of Byron” is “one which makes one dream.”

## _“anti-fashion fashion icon.”_

Byron is considered by some to be an “anti-fashion fashion icon.” Beau Brummell stiffened his neckclothes, but Byron wore “unstarched and undone shirts” to set a “standard for casual masculinity that in its disheveled style served as a prototype for later Bohemians.”<sup>1</sup> Stendhal once met Byron in Milan in 1816, and gave this comment: “I shall never forget” the “divine expression of his look; it was the serene look of genius and power.”<sup>2</sup> However, in a letter dated December 10, 1822 to John Murray, Lord Byron declared that he had lived in “three or four” different worlds during his thirty-four years on earth.<sup>3</sup>

George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron, (1788-1824) was a British Romantic poet, reviewer, and satirist. The son of the handsome Captain John Byron and his second wife Catherine Gordon, a Scottish heiress, Byron was noted for his lameness due to his birth defect, a clubfoot. He was poor before the age of 10, but he inherited the title and fortune of his great-uncle William, the 5 th Baron Byron in 1798. As a result, Byron was sent to Harrow (1801-1805) and met the sensuous Lord Grey de Ruthyn. Regardless of what happened, Byron told his half-sister Augusta Byron many years later: “I am not reconciled to Lord Grey, and I never will” (BLJ 1:46).<sup>4</sup> In 1803 he fell in love with but was rejected by his already engaged cousin, Mary Chaworth. He left for Cambridge in 1805 and developed homophiliac attachments to John Edelston and Robert Rushton. In 1809 Byron took his seat in the House of Lords.

## Byron’s Grand Tour (1809-1811)

Byron’s Grand Tour (1809-1811) with his lifelong friend, John Cam Hobhouse, led him to Portugal, Spain, Malta, Greece, Albania, and Turkey. In Greece he swam the Hellespont to mimic Leander.<sup>5</sup> Byron was drawn to Spanish, Maltese, Greek women, but he found the grandsons of Ali Pasha particularly fascinating: “They are totally unlike our lads, have painted complexions like rouged dowagers, large black eyes" features perfectly regular. They are the prettiest little animals I ever saw”(BLJ 1:231). Child Harold’s Pilgrimage was published in 1812 and greatly enhanced the poet’s popularity. Byron’s famous response was this: “I awoke one morning and found myself famous.”

## Polysexuality

Byron had multiple affairs in England. He loved Caroline Lamb, the wife of William Lamb—the second son of Lord Melbourne. The eccentric Caroline was wont to cross-dress as a page or a young boy during some of their assignations. After a failed elopement, Byron had an affair with Lady Oxford, followed by romantic entanglements with his half-sister Augusta, the wife of Colonel George Leigh. In the meantime he also flirted with Lady Frances Webster, and always welcomed emotional triangulations to avoid deep commitment.

In 1815 he decided to settle down and marry the high-minded Annabella Milbanke, the niece of Lady Melbourne. Lady Byron gave birth to a daughter, Augusta Ada Byron, but soon moved to live with her parents in 1816 amid rumors of Byron’s incestuous love of his half-sister as well as his polysexuality. The marriage ended in a legal separation in the same year. Byron immediately went on an exile, and never returned to England. Byron stayed with the Shelleys in Switzerland, and quickly began an affair with Mary Godwin’s half sister Claire Clairmont, who later gave birth to Allegra in 1817. The mother gave Allegra to the father, and Byron left her to be raised in a convent, where Allegra died at the age of five in 1822, having never been visited by her father.

In Italy, Byron loved his landlord’s wife Marianna Segati but always preferred polyamorous pursuits. He informed a friend Douglas Kinnaird that he had “a dozen” new loves (BLJ 6:42), and to another friend, James Wedderburn Webster that he had fun with “around two hundred” Venetian women (BLJ 6:65-6). In 1819, he reported his conquest: “some of them” were “Countesses,” some of them were “wives,” “some noble—some middling—some low--" all whores” (BLJ 6:92). His Italian adventures inspired Don Juan—an unfinished epic poem.

## Byron’s Decline

Byron looked old and fat in 1818 but this soon changed because of the 19 year old Countess Teresa Gamba Guiccioli, the wife of an elderly but powerful diplomat Conte Alessandro Guiccioli. Byron was also known for being her gentleman –in-waiting. In a letter dated 1819, Byron made this claim: “You sometimes tell me I have been your first real love—and I assure that you shall be my last Passion. I may well hope not to fall in love again, now that everything has become indifferent to me. Before I knew you—I felt an interest in many women, but never in one only. Now I love you, there is no other woman in the world for me.”<sup>6</sup> They stayed together until 1823.

Byron journeyed to Greece to fight for the country’s independence from Turkish rule in 1823. Leigh Hunt gave an unflattering picture of a queer Byron in the Levant: “the Grand Signior is said to have taken him for a woman in disguise,” with hair "oiled and trimmed with all the anxiety of a Sardanapalus" and “delicate white hand…. holding a handkerchief, upon which his jeweled fingers lay embedded.”<sup>7</sup> Byron succumbed to sickness and died at Missolonghi on April 19, 1824.

## Legacy

“She Walks in Beauty” is one of the most widely anthologized works of Byron.

_She walks in beauty, like the night_

_Of cloudless climes and starry skies;_

_And all that’s best of dark and bright_

_Meet in her aspect and her eyes;_

_Thus mellowed to that tender light_

_Which heaven to gaudy day denies._

_One shade the more, one ray the less,_

_Had half impaired the nameless grace_

_Which waves in every raven tress,_

_Or softly lightens o’er her face;_

_Where thoughts serenely sweet express,_

_How pure, how dear their dwelling-place._

_And on that cheek, and o’er that brow,_

_So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,_

_The smiles that win, the tints that glow,_

_But tell of days in goodness spent,_

_A mind at peace with all below,_

_A heart whose love is innocent!_
