Emma Hamilton was a muse who defined neoclassicism through her alluring modelling and performances in the “Attitudes” and through George Romney's paintings, one of the best-known portrait painters of the time. Her attractive looks captured the attention of many rich aristocrats, becoming the mistress of a notable few, including Lord Nelson.

With slightly pouted cherry-red lips, flowing chestnut hair, blue eyes and flushed cheeks, Emma was “a spectacle performing to a crowd” (source). She represented what society women wanted to be, changing the trends of fashion from stiff corsets and petticoats, to sexy flowing dresses with high waists (source). Additionally, her life was often depicted as dazzling and glamorous, often gossiped and shared about in newspapers (source). Yet it was her achievements and natural beauty that led to her downfall.

## Humble Origins

Born in 1765 as Amy Lyon (source), Emma was quick to start working as an “under-nursemaid”, a domestic worker who cares for children within a large household, at age 12 (source). She was also quick to realise the greatest advantage that would help her survive in the world of aristocratic privilege and powerful men: her physical attractiveness.

## Rising to Fame

At age 15, Emma was soon hired by Sir Harry Fetherstonhaugh, an English aristocrat for several months as a hostess and entertainer, were what she called her ‘giddy ways’ attracted other aristocrats (source). Her work included seductively dancing naked on the dining tables (source). By age 17, she had already borne a child by one of the guests.

She then became a mistress to Charles Francis Greville on the condition that she change her name to Emma Hart and foster out her child (source). Through him, she caught the attention of George Romney and was soon his muse. She would pose as Greek figures such as the Goddess of Venus, producing some of Romney’s greatest works, which made her a celebrity (source).

Greville soon grew tired of Emma and sent her to his uncle Sir William Hamilton, the British ambassador to the Kingdom of Naples in Italy. She was unknowingly abandoned under the pretence that Hamilton would “look after her for a while”. Hamilton found Emma very attractive (source).

Once Emma found out about the exchange, she was furious but eventually accepted her new wealthy life with Hamilton. She married him at age 26, becoming Emma Hamilton, and rose to high Neapolitan society, where she grew quite close to Queen Maria Carolina of Naples and Sicily (source). At this point, Emma spent lavishly on balls, dinners and parties, where she would dance, sing and celebrate the passing of any English aristocrat (source).

With Hamilton’s encouragement, she started performing the “Attitudes”, also known as mimo-plastic arts, where she would dress in shawls and with her experience with Romney, combine classical poses with modern allure, acting as notable Greek figures (source). Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, theatre director and critic, wrote “The performance is like nothing you have ever seen before. With a few scarves and shawls she expressed a variety of wonderful transformations. One pose after another without a break” (source).

## Love Affair

Two years after she married Sir William, she had met Lord Horatio Nelson, a hero who led Britain’s victory over the French navy. They were madly in love despite both being married, as Emma wrote "I must sin on and love him more than ever, It is a crime worth going to Hell for." (source). In 1801 at age 36, Emma bore a child by Nelson, named Horatia. This was when Nelson decided to finally leave his wife and live with Emma (source).

## Tragedy

In 1803, Hamilton died of illness, and two years later Nelson was killed at the Battle of Trafalgar. Emma was distraught, as she wrote: ‘Life to me is not worth having. I lived for [Nelson]. His glory I gloried in ... But I cannot go on. My heart and head are gone’ (source). At age 46, it was reported that she looked like an old woman with grey hair, and had become very fat (source).

Maintaining her wealthy lifestyle, she continued to spend lavishly, building high debts until she was arrested for two years. After her release, she fled to Calais with Horatia, living in a cramped, dismal lodging, drinking wistful champagne until her death at age 49 (source)
